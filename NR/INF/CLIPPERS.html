            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>CLIPPERS (Chronic Lymphocytic Inflammation with Pontine Perivascular Enhancement Responsive to Steroids) typically presents with subacute onset of brainstem and/or cerebellar symptoms, including ataxia, diplopia, dysarthria, and cognitive impairment.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>CLIPPERS is a rare inflammatory disorder that predominantly affects adults, with a slight male predominance. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated process.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>CLIPPERS is characterized by perivascular inflammation in the central nervous system, particularly in the pons and cerebellum. The inflammation is predominantly composed of lymphocytes.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The mainstay of treatment for CLIPPERS is corticosteroids, which can lead to rapid clinical improvement. However, long-term immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary to prevent relapses.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Characteristic punctate or curvilinear enhancing lesions in the pons and/or cerebellum on MRI</li>
                <li>Enhancement is typically perivascular and can extend into the surrounding white matter</li>
                <li>Lesions may show a "salt-and-pepper" appearance on T2-weighted imaging</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary CNS lymphoma</li>
                <li>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
                <li>Neuromyelitis optica (NMO)</li>
                <li>Central pontine myelinolysis</li>
