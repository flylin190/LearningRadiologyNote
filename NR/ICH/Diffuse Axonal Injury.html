    <h1>Diffuse Axonal Injury (DAI)</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>DAI can result in a range of symptoms, including unconsciousness, confusion, agitation, seizures, and focal neurological deficits.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>DAI commonly occurs in patients with severe head trauma, such as those involved in motor vehicle accidents or falls.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>DAI is characterized by widespread damage to the axons in the brain, which occurs due to shearing forces during the injury. This can lead to axonal swelling and disconnection, disrupting the brain's communication network.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for DAI, but management focuses on supportive care and rehabilitation to address symptoms and maximize recovery.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Diffuse axonal injury may not be visible on CT scans immediately after injury but can be seen on MRI scans as small punctate hemorrhages or white matter abnormalities.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Concussion</li>
                <li>Brain contusion</li>
                <li>Primary brain injury</li>
            </ul>
