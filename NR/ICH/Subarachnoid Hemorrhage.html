            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage typically presents with a sudden, severe headache, often described as the worst headache of one's life. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, neck stiffness, and altered consciousness.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage is most commonly caused by the rupture of a cerebral aneurysm. It can occur at any age, but it is more common in adults and slightly more common in women than men.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Subarachnoid hemorrhage is characterized by bleeding into the subarachnoid space, which is the space between the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater that surrounds the brain.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for subarachnoid hemorrhage aims to stop the bleeding, prevent complications such as vasospasm and hydrocephalus, and manage symptoms. This may include surgery to clip or coil the ruptured aneurysm, medications to prevent vasospasm, and supportive care.</p>
