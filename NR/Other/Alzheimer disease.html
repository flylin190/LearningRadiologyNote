            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that presents with memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with language and decision-making. As the disease progresses, individuals may experience personality changes and impaired motor function.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia in older adults, affecting millions of people worldwide. The risk of developing Alzheimer's disease increases with age.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain, leading to the loss of neurons and brain tissue. The exact cause of these abnormalities is not fully understood.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease, but medications such as cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can help improve symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Non-pharmacological interventions, such as cognitive training and support for caregivers, are also important.</p>
