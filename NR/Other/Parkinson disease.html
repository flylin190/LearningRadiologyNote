            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The primary symptoms of Parkinson's disease include tremor, bradykinesia (slow movement), rigidity, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive impairment, depression, and sleep disturbances, can also occur.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting approximately 1% of individuals over 60 years old. The prevalence increases with age, and men are slightly more affected than women.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Parkinson's disease is characterized by the progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra region of the midbrain, leading to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Parkinson's disease typically involves a combination of medications (e.g., levodopa, dopamine agonists, MAO-B inhibitors) to manage symptoms, physical therapy, and in some cases, deep brain stimulation surgery.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reduced signal intensity in the substantia nigra on T2-weighted MRI</li>
                <li>Potential atrophy and volume loss in the midbrain and brainstem</li>
                <li>Functional imaging may show decreased dopamine transporter binding</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy)</li>
                <li>Secondary parkinsonism (e.g., drug-induced, vascular)</li>
                <li>Essential tremor</li>
