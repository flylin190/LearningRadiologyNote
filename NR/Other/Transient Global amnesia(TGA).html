            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Transient global amnesia (TGA) is characterized by the sudden onset of temporary memory loss, usually lasting for a few hours. During an episode of TGA, individuals experience an inability to form new memories, although they retain memories of their identity and past experiences.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>TGA is a rare condition, typically affecting individuals over the age of 50. The exact cause of TGA is unknown, but it is believed to be related to a temporary disruption in blood flow to the brain.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact pathology of TGA is not well understood. It is thought to be related to a temporary disruption in blood flow to certain areas of the brain, particularly the hippocampus, which plays a key role in memory formation.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for TGA, as the condition usually resolves on its own within a few hours. During an episode of TGA, it is important to ensure the safety of the individual and monitor their condition until the memory loss resolves.</p>
