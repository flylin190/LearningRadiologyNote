            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include muscle weakness, twitching, and eventually muscle wasting, leading to paralysis.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>ALS can affect anyone, but it is more common in people aged 40-70. Men are slightly more likely to develop ALS than women.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>ALS is characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. This leads to muscle weakness and eventually paralysis.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for ALS, but treatment can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life. This may include medications, physical therapy, and respiratory support.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>No specific imaging features are diagnostic of ALS, but MRI may show atrophy of the motor cortex and corticospinal tracts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other motor neuron diseases</li>
                <li>Muscle disorders</li>
                <li>Peripheral neuropathy</li>
