            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a rare, degenerative, fatal brain disorder. Early symptoms include memory problems, behavioral changes, poor coordination, and visual disturbances. Later, individuals may develop involuntary movements, blindness, weakness, and coma. </p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>CJD affects about one in every one million people per year worldwide; in the United States, there are about 350 cases per year. CJD usually appears in later life and runs a rapid course.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>CJD is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal prion proteins in the brain, which leads to the death of brain cells. These abnormal proteins are believed to cause other normal proteins to become misshapen, leading to a chain reaction that results in the death of brain cells.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for CJD, and treatment is focused on alleviating symptoms and making the person as comfortable as possible. Supportive care, such as physical therapy, can help manage symptoms and improve quality of life.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Brain MRI may show high signal intensity in the basal ganglia on T2-weighted images</li>
                <li>Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) may show cortical ribboning</li>
                <li>Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) may show hypometabolism in affected areas</li>
            </ul>
