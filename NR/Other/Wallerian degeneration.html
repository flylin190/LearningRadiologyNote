    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Wallerian degeneration is not a disease but a process of nerve degeneration that occurs after a nerve injury. Symptoms depend on the location and extent of the injury but may include weakness, numbness, and muscle atrophy.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Wallerian degeneration can occur in individuals of any age who experience nerve injury.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Wallerian degeneration is characterized by the degeneration of the distal portion of a nerve fiber following injury to the nerve.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for Wallerian degeneration. Recovery depends on the extent of the nerve injury and may include physical therapy to improve function.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Diffusion restriction on MRI in the affected nerve fibers</li>
                <li>Atrophy of the affected muscles</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP)</li>
                <li>Peripheral nerve sheath tumors</li>
                <li>Neuropathies due to metabolic or toxic causes</li>
