            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of PML include progressive weakness on one side of the body, clumsiness, vision problems, and changes in personality, mood, or behavior.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>PML is a rare disease that usually occurs in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive medications.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>PML is caused by the JC virus, which is a common virus that is harmless in most people but can cause PML in those with weakened immune systems.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for PML, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help improve the immune system's response to the JC virus.</p>
