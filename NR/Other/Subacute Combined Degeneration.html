    <h1>Subacute Combined Degeneration</h1>

            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Subacute combined degeneration (SCD) is a neurological complication of vitamin B12 deficiency. Symptoms may include numbness or tingling in the hands and feet, problems with balance and coordination, and cognitive difficulties.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>SCD is most commonly caused by pernicious anemia, an autoimmune condition that affects the absorption of vitamin B12. It can also result from other causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, such as dietary insufficiency or malabsorption.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>SCD is characterized by degeneration of the spinal cord, particularly the dorsal and lateral columns, as well as peripheral nerves. This degeneration is caused by a lack of myelin, which is essential for the proper function of nerve fibers.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for SCD is vitamin B12 supplementation, either orally or by injection. In some cases, additional treatment may be needed to manage symptoms, such as physical therapy for balance and coordination problems.</p>
