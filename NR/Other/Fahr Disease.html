    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Fahr disease is characterized by bilateral and symmetric calcifications in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. Patients may present with movement disorders, cognitive impairment, psychiatric symptoms, or seizures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Fahr disease is a rare disorder with an unknown prevalence. It typically presents in mid-adulthood, but can occur at any age.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Fahr disease is unknown, but it is thought to be related to abnormalities in calcium metabolism. Genetic factors may also play a role.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for Fahr disease. Management is supportive and focused on addressing symptoms, such as medications for movement disorders or seizures.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bilateral and symmetric calcifications in the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Calcifications may also be seen in other brain regions, such as the thalamus or cerebellum</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypoparathyroidism</li>
                <li>Idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (Fahr syndrome)</li>
                <li>Metabolic disorders affecting calcium metabolism</li>
