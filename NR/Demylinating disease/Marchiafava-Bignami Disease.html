            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Marchiafava-Bignami Disease is a rare neurological disorder characterized by demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum. Symptoms may include confusion, disorientation, seizures, and coma.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Marchiafava-Bignami Disease is most commonly seen in chronic alcoholics, although cases have been reported in non-alcoholic patients as well. The exact cause is unknown.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The pathology of Marchiafava-Bignami Disease involves demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum, which is thought to be related to chronic alcohol abuse and nutritional deficiencies.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for Marchiafava-Bignami Disease, and management focuses on supportive care and addressing underlying causes, such as alcohol cessation and nutritional support.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Loss of normal hyperintense signal in the corpus callosum on T1-weighted MRI</li>
                <li>Restricted diffusion in the affected areas on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI)</li>
                <li>Atrophy of the corpus callosum in later stages</li>
