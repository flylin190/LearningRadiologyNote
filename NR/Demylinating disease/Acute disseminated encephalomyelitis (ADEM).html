            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>ADEM is a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. It often presents with symptoms similar to those of a viral infection, such as fever, headache, and fatigue, followed by neurological symptoms such as confusion, weakness, and vision loss.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>ADEM can occur at any age, but it is most common in children and adolescents. It is thought to be triggered by an infection or vaccination that causes the immune system to attack the myelin sheath, which is the protective covering of nerve fibers.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>ADEM is characterized by widespread inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune response triggered by an environmental factor.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for ADEM usually involves high-dose corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system. In severe cases, other immunosuppressive therapies may be used.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple areas of demyelination on MRI</li>
                <li>Lesions are typically large, asymmetrical, and involve both the white and gray matter</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiphasic disseminated encephalomyelitis (MDEM)</li>
                <li>Multiple sclerosis (MS)</li>
