            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of multiple sclerosis vary widely, depending on the location and severity of the nerve damage. Common symptoms include fatigue, walking difficulties, numbness or tingling, muscle weakness, vision problems, dizziness, and problems with coordination and balance.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Multiple sclerosis is more common in women than men, and it usually begins between the ages of 20 and 40. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve an autoimmune response against myelin, the protective covering of nerve fibers.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Multiple sclerosis is characterized by the formation of plaques or lesions in the central nervous system, which consist of areas of demyelination and inflammation. These plaques disrupt the normal transmission of nerve impulses.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for multiple sclerosis, but treatment can help manage symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment options include medications to reduce inflammation and modify the immune response, as well as physical therapy and lifestyle changes.</p>
