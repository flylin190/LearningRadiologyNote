            <h2>Cerebral Blood Flow (CBF)</h2>
            <p>CBF represents the amount of blood flow per unit volume of brain tissue per unit time. It is measured in ml/100g/min. Decreased CBF may indicate ischemia or reduced perfusion.</p>

            <h2>Cerebral Blood Volume (CBV)</h2>
            <p>CBV represents the total volume of blood in a region of the brain. It is measured in ml/100g. Increased CBV may indicate hyperemia or increased blood volume.</p>

            <h2>Mean Transit Time (MTT)</h2>
            <p>MTT represents the average time it takes for blood to pass through a region of the brain. It is measured in seconds (s). Prolonged MTT may indicate delayed perfusion.</p>

            <h2>Time to Peak (TTP)</h2>
            <p>TTP represents the time it takes for the contrast agent to reach its maximum concentration in a region of the brain. It is measured in seconds (s). Prolonged TTP may indicate delayed perfusion.</p>

            <h2>Permeability Surface Area Product (PS)</h2>
            <p>PS represents the permeability of blood vessels and the surface area available for exchange of substances. It is measured in ml/100g/min. Increased PS may indicate increased permeability.</p>

            <h2>Relative Cerebral Blood Flow (rCBF)</h2>
            <p>rCBF represents the CBF in a region of the brain relative to a reference region. It is a normalized value for comparison.</p>
