            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Subependymomas are typically slow-growing tumors, and symptoms depend on their location and size. They can cause headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits due to mass effect on surrounding structures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Subependymomas are rare, accounting for approximately 0.7% of all primary brain tumors. They can occur at any age but are most common in adults, with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades of life.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Subependymomas are benign, slow-growing tumors that arise from the ependymal cells lining the ventricular system or central canal of the spinal cord. They are typically well-circumscribed, firm, and may have a cystic component.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for subependymomas typically involves surgical resection, which can be curative in many cases. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered for incompletely resected or high-grade tumors.</p>
