            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Choroid plexus xanthogranulomas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can rarely cause symptoms such as headaches, hydrocephalus, or focal neurological deficits if they grow large enough to obstruct cerebrospinal fluid flow.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Choroid plexus xanthogranulomas are rare lesions that can occur in individuals of all ages, but are more commonly seen in older adults. They are typically benign and do not usually require treatment unless they cause symptoms.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Choroid plexus xanthogranulomas are characterized by the presence of xanthomatous cells within the choroid plexus, which are lipid-laden macrophages. The exact cause of these lesions is not well understood.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most choroid plexus xanthogranulomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. In cases where treatment is necessary, surgical resection may be considered.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, lobulated mass within the choroid plexus</li>
                <li>May appear hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI due to lipid content</li>
                <li>Enhancement with contrast may be seen</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Choroid plexus papilloma</li>
                <li>Choroid plexus carcinoma</li>
                <li>Colloid cyst of the third ventricle</li>
                <li>Meningioma</li>
