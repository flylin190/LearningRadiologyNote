            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of glioblastoma include headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, cognitive changes, weakness on one side of the body, and personality or mood changes.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of primary brain tumor in adults. It can occur at any age but is more common in older adults, with a peak incidence between 45 and 70 years old.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Glioblastoma is characterized by highly cellular areas with pseudopalisading necrosis, microvascular proliferation, and endothelial proliferation. It is graded as Grade IV astrocytoma according to the WHO classification of central nervous system tumors.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for glioblastoma usually involves surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Despite treatment, prognosis for glioblastoma remains poor, with a median survival of around 12-15 months.</p>
