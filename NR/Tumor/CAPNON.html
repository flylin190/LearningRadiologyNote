    <h1>Calcifying Pseudoneoplasm of the Neuraxis(CAPNON)</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>CAPNON are often asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, some patients may experience symptoms related to mass effect, such as headaches, seizures, or neurological deficits.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>CAPNON are rare lesions, primarily affecting children and young adults. They account for approximately 0.7% of intracranial masses.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>CAPNONs are usually solitary extra-axial, or less frequently intra-axial, masses. They are benign, slow-growing lesions composed of fibrous tissue, calcifications, and a variable degree of chronic inflammation. They typically arise from the subependymal region or the choroid plexus.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for calcifying pseudoneoplasms depends on the size, location, and symptoms caused by the lesion. Small, asymptomatic lesions may be observed, while larger or symptomatic lesions may require surgical resection.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed, calcified mass</li>
                <li>Typically located in the supratentorial region</li>
                <li>Minimal or no enhancement on contrast-enhanced MRI</li>
                <li>Possible associated edema or mass effect</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Craniopharyngioma</li>
                <li>Low-grade glioma</li>
