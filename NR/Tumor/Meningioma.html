            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Meningiomas can cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and changes in cognitive function or personality, depending on their location and size.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumors, accounting for about 30% of all primary brain tumors. They are more common in women than men and are most frequently diagnosed in adults between the ages of 40 and 70.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Meningiomas arise from the meninges, the protective layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord. They are typically slow-growing tumors and are classified based on their histological features.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment of meningioma depends on several factors, including the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Treatment options may include observation, surgery, radiation therapy, and in some cases, chemotherapy.</p>
