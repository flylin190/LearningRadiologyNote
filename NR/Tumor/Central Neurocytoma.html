            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of central neurocytoma can include headaches, nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or cognitive impairment, depending on the location and size of the tumor.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Central neurocytomas are rare tumors, accounting for approximately 0.1-0.5% of all primary brain tumors. They typically occur in young adults, with a peak incidence in the third decade of life.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Central neurocytomas are well-differentiated, slow-growing tumors of neuronal origin. They typically arise in the lateral ventricles, particularly in the area of the foramen of Monro, and may contain calcifications.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for central neurocytoma typically involves surgical resection, which can be curative in many cases. Adjuvant radiation therapy may be considered for incompletely resected or high-grade tumors.</p>
