            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Intracranial Schwannomas often present with symptoms related to the compression of adjacent structures. These symptoms can include hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, balance problems, facial numbness or weakness, and headaches.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Intracranial Schwannomas are rare tumors, accounting for only 8-10% of all intracranial tumors. They can occur at any age but are more common in adults between 30-60 years old.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Intracranial Schwannomas arise from the Schwann cells of the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear nerve). They are typically benign and slow-growing tumors.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for Intracranial Schwannomas is surgical resection. In some cases, observation may be appropriate for small tumors with no or minimal symptoms. Radiation therapy may be considered for tumors that are not surgically accessible or for residual tumors after surgery.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed, enhancing mass on MRI</li>
                <li>Typically located in the cerebellopontine angle</li>
                <li>May show hypointensity on T1-weighted MRI and hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI</li>
