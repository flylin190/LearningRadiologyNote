            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of CNS germinoma depend on the location of the tumor, but may include headaches, visual disturbances, hormonal imbalances, and neurological deficits such as weakness, numbness, or cognitive impairment.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>CNS germinomas are rare tumors, accounting for approximately 0.5-3.4% of primary brain tumors. They predominantly affect children and young adults, with a peak incidence in the second decade of life.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Germinomas are malignant germ cell tumors that arise from primordial germ cells. In the CNS, they most commonly occur in the pineal and suprasellar regions, but can also develop in other locations along the midline.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for CNS germinoma typically involves radiation therapy, with or without chemotherapy. Surgery may be performed in certain cases for biopsy or to relieve mass effect.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, homogeneous mass</li>
                <li>Commonly located in the pineal or suprasellar region</li>
                <li>Intense, homogeneous enhancement on contrast-enhanced imaging</li>
                <li>Possible associated obstructive hydrocephalus</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pituitary adenoma</li>
                <li>Craniopharyngioma</li>
