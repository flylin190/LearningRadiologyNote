            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) are low-grade brain tumors that often cause seizures, which may be focal or generalized. Other symptoms may include headaches, neurological deficits, or behavioral changes.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>DNETs are most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life. They are more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>DNETs are characterized by the presence of glioneuronal elements with a distinctive appearance under the microscope. They are typically slow-growing and considered benign, but can cause significant morbidity due to their tendency to cause seizures.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for DNETs is surgical resection, which aims to remove as much of the tumor as possible while preserving neurological function. In cases where complete resection is not possible, adjuvant therapies such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be used.</p>

                <li>Well-defined, often cystic mass with a mural nodule</li>
                <li>Location in the temporal lobe is common</li>
                <li>May show no or minimal enhancement on MRI</li>
