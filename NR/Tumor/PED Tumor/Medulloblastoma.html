            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of medulloblastoma include headaches, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, balance problems, difficulty walking, and changes in vision or hearing. In children, symptoms may also include irritability, changes in personality, and delays in developmental milestones.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Medulloblastoma is the most common malignant brain tumor in children, but it can also occur in adults. It typically affects children between the ages of 3 and 8 years old, and there is a slight male predominance.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor that arises in the cerebellum. It is characterized by small, round, blue cells with high mitotic activity. Histologically, it shows sheets of undifferentiated cells with scant cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for medulloblastoma usually involves surgical resection followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The specific treatment plan may vary depending on the patient's age, tumor size, and extent of spread.</p>
