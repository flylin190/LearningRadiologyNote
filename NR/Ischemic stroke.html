            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of ischemic stroke include sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech, trouble seeing in one or both eyes, trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination, and severe headache with no known cause.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Ischemic stroke is the most common type of stroke and can affect people of all ages. However, the risk increases with age, and it is more common in men than women.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for ischemic stroke is to restore blood flow to the affected part of the brain. This can be done with medication (such as tissue plasminogen activator or tPA) or with a mechanical thrombectomy, a procedure to remove the blood clot causing the stroke.</p>
