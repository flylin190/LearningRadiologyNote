        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most patients with developmental venous anomaly (DVA) are asymptomatic and the anomaly is usually discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, in rare cases, it may be associated with seizures or neurological deficits.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>DVAs are considered common and are often found in up to 2-3% of the general population. They are typically discovered incidentally on brain imaging studies.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>DVAs are benign anatomical variants of venous drainage and are not true vascular malformations. They consist of a single or multiple dilated medullary veins converging toward a central vein that drains into a deep or superficial venous system.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most DVAs do not require treatment. Management is typically focused on addressing any associated symptoms or complications, such as seizures.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Radial or spoke-like arrangement of veins on imaging</li>
                <li>Convergence of veins toward a central vein</li>
                <li>Drainage into a deep or superficial venous system</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cavernous malformation</li>
                <li>Venous angioma</li>
