            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of Moyamoya disease include transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), strokes, and seizures. In children, it may present with headaches and developmental delay.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Moyamoya disease is a rare, progressive cerebrovascular disorder that primarily affects children, but it can also occur in adults.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Moyamoya disease is characterized by the progressive narrowing of the internal carotid arteries and their branches, leading to the development of collateral vessels ("moyamoya vessels") at the base of the brain.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Moyamoya disease aims to improve blood flow to the brain and prevent stroke. This may include surgical revascularization procedures to bypass the narrowed arteries.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid arteries and/or middle cerebral arteries on angiography</li>
                <li>"Puff of smoke" appearance on angiography due to the development of collateral vessels</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Atherosclerotic stenosis of cerebral arteries</li>
                <li>Other vasculopathies (e.g., fibromuscular dysplasia)</li>
