            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Dural sinus thrombosis can present with headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, altered mental status, and signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as papilledema.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Dural sinus thrombosis is a rare condition that can affect individuals of any age, but it is more common in women and those with certain risk factors, such as pregnancy, oral contraceptive use, and hypercoagulable states.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Dural sinus thrombosis is characterized by the formation of a blood clot in the dural venous sinuses, which can lead to impaired venous drainage from the brain.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for dural sinus thrombosis may include anticoagulation therapy to prevent further clot formation and allow existing clots to dissolve. In some cases, thrombectomy or thrombolysis may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Filling defect in the affected dural sinus on contrast-enhanced CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI due to thrombus</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Meningitis</li>
                <li>Subdural hematoma</li>
                <li>Brain abscess</li>
