            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Dolichoectasis of the intracranial arteries is often asymptomatic but can present with symptoms related to compression of surrounding structures or thromboembolic events. Symptoms may include headache, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Dolichoectasis is more common in older adults and is often associated with hypertension and atherosclerosis.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Dolichoectasis refers to elongation and tortuosity of the intracranial arteries. It can involve the anterior, middle, or posterior cerebral arteries, and is thought to result from degenerative changes in the arterial wall.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for dolichoectasis depends on the symptoms and complications. It may include medication to control blood pressure and prevent thromboembolic events, as well as surgical or endovascular intervention in some cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Elongation and tortuosity of intracranial arteries on imaging studies such as MRI or angiography</li>
                <li>May show compression of adjacent structures, such as cranial nerves or the brainstem</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Arteriovenous malformation (AVM)</li>
                <li>Arterial dissection</li>
                <li>Normal variant</li>
