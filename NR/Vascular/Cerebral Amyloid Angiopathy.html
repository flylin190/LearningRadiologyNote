            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy can present with lobar intracerebral hemorrhages, cognitive impairment, and transient neurological deficits (amyloid spells).</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is a common condition in the elderly population, affecting up to 30% of individuals over 60 years old. It is also associated with Alzheimer's disease.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cerebral amyloid angiopathy is characterized by the deposition of amyloid-beta protein in the walls of small to medium-sized arteries and arterioles in the brain, leading to vessel fragility and an increased risk of hemorrhage.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for cerebral amyloid angiopathy is primarily supportive, focusing on managing the complications of hemorrhage and cognitive impairment. Anticoagulants and antiplatelets should be used cautiously due to the increased risk of bleeding.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lobar intracerebral hemorrhages, often with a predilection for the posterior brain regions</li>
                <li>Cerebral microbleeds, particularly in the lobar regions</li>
                <li>Cortical superficial siderosis (hemosiderin deposition in the cortical subarachnoid spaces)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hypertensive hemorrhage</li>
                <li>Vascular malformations</li>
                <li>Coagulopathy</li>
                <li>Amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) in Alzheimer's disease</li>
