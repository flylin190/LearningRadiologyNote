    <h1>Cortical Tuber</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Cortical tubers themselves are often asymptomatic, but they can be associated with various neurological symptoms, such as seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and autism spectrum disorder, depending on their location and extent.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cortical tubers are primarily seen in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 individuals worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cortical tubers are focal malformations of cortical development, characterized by abnormal proliferation and migration of neural progenitor cells. They consist of dysplastic neurons, giant cells, and calcifications, and are associated with disruption of cortical architecture and organization.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for cortical tubers is primarily focused on managing associated symptoms, such as seizures and developmental delays. Antiepileptic medications are often used to control seizures, and various therapies (e.g., physical, occupational, and speech therapy) may be recommended for developmental delays.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-demarcated cortical lesions with a "tuber-like" appearance</li>
                <li>Hyperintense on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences</li>
                <li>Hypointense on T1-weighted sequences</li>
                <li>Calcifications may be present</li>
                <li>Commonly located in the subcortical white matter or at the cortical-white matter junction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other cortical malformations (e.g., focal cortical dysplasia, heterotopia)</li>
                <li>Low-grade gliomas</li>
                <li>Ischemic or traumatic cortical scarring</li>
            </ul>
