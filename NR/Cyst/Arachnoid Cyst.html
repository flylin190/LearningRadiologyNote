            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Arachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. However, larger cysts or those in certain locations may cause symptoms such as headaches, seizures, nausea, vomiting, and visual disturbances.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Arachnoid cysts are more common in children than adults. They can occur anywhere along the arachnoid membrane, but are most commonly found in the middle cranial fossa.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Arachnoid cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop between the arachnoid membrane and the brain or spinal cord. The exact cause is unknown, but they are thought to develop during embryonic development.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Small, asymptomatic arachnoid cysts may not require treatment. However, larger cysts causing symptoms may be drained surgically or treated with endoscopic fenestration to allow the cyst to drain into the subarachnoid space.</p>
