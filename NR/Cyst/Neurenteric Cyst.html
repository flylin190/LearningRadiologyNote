            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Neurenteric cysts can cause a variety of symptoms depending on their location and size, including back pain, radiculopathy, myelopathy, or bowel and bladder dysfunction.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Neurenteric cysts are rare congenital lesions that occur along the spine or in the skull base. They are thought to arise from abnormal embryonic development of the notochord and neuroenteric canal.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Neurenteric cysts are benign cystic lesions lined by cuboidal or columnar epithelium, which may contain mucin or other secretions. They are typically located in the spinal canal, intracranial compartment, or abdomen.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for neurenteric cysts typically involves surgical resection, as they can cause compression of adjacent structures and often recur if incompletely removed.</p>
