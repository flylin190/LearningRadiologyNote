            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of porencephalic cysts can vary depending on the size and location of the cyst. Common symptoms include developmental delays, seizures, and neurological deficits.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Porencephalic cysts are rare and can occur at any age. They may be present at birth or develop later in life as a result of trauma, infection, or stroke.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Porencephalic cysts are fluid-filled cavities in the brain that result from abnormal development or damage to brain tissue. The exact cause is often unknown.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for porencephalic cysts focuses on managing symptoms, such as seizures, and may include antiepileptic medications. In some cases, surgery may be considered to drain the cyst or reduce pressure on surrounding brain tissue.</p>
