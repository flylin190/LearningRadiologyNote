            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Neuroglial cysts are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. They may rarely cause symptoms if they become large enough to compress surrounding structures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Neuroglial cysts are rare and can occur at any age, but are most commonly found in children and young adults.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Neuroglial cysts are benign cystic lesions lined by glial tissue, typically located in the brain or spinal cord.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Asymptomatic neuroglial cysts may not require treatment. Symptomatic cysts may be surgically removed if they are causing symptoms.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined cystic lesion with smooth margins on MRI</li>
                <li>No enhancement or surrounding edema</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Arachnoid cyst</li>
                <li>Epidermoid cyst</li>
