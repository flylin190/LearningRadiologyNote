            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Leigh Syndrome is a progressive neurological disorder that typically presents in infancy or early childhood. Symptoms may include developmental delay, loss of motor skills, weakness, and respiratory problems.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Leigh Syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 40,000 newborns. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA or nuclear DNA that affect mitochondrial function.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The pathology of Leigh Syndrome involves bilateral symmetrical necrotic lesions in the brain, particularly in the basal ganglia and brainstem. These lesions result in progressive neurological decline.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no cure for Leigh Syndrome, and treatment focuses on managing symptoms and providing supportive care. This may include physical therapy, respiratory support, and medications to control seizures.</p>
