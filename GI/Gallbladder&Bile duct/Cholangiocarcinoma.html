            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma may include jaundice, abdominal pain, weight loss, fever, and pruritus (itching).</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cholangiocarcinoma is a relatively rare cancer, accounting for approximately 3% of all gastrointestinal cancers. It is more common in individuals with underlying conditions such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and liver fluke infections.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cholangiocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the bile duct epithelium. It can occur in the intrahepatic (within the liver) or extrahepatic (outside the liver) bile ducts.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for cholangiocarcinoma depend on the location and stage of the tumor, but may include surgical resection, liver transplantation, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these modalities.</p>
