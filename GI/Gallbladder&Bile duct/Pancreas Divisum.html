    <h1>Pancreas Divisum</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Pancreas divisum is often asymptomatic, but it can cause recurrent pancreatitis, abdominal pain, and impaired pancreatic function.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pancreas divisum is a relatively common congenital anomaly, occurring in approximately 5-10% of the population.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pancreas divisum is a congenital anomaly in which the pancreatic duct system fails to fuse properly during embryonic development. As a result, the main pancreatic duct drains only the head, body, and part of the tail of the pancreas, while the accessory duct drains the remaining portion of the tail.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for pancreas divisum is typically conservative, involving pain management and lifestyle modifications. In severe cases, endoscopic or surgical interventions may be required to improve pancreatic drainage.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Failure of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic ducts to fuse</li>
                <li>Dilated accessory pancreatic duct</li>
                <li>Restricted outflow of the accessory duct into the minor papilla</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chronic pancreatitis</li>
                <li>Pancreatic ductal obstruction</li>
                <li>Pancreatic neoplasms</li>
