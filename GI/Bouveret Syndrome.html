    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Bouveret syndrome is characterized by symptoms of gastric outlet obstruction, including nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. It can also lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Bouveret syndrome is a rare complication of gallstone disease, typically occurring in older adults with a history of gallstones.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Bouveret syndrome occurs when a large gallstone erodes through the wall of the gallbladder and into the duodenum or stomach, causing obstruction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Bouveret syndrome may involve endoscopic removal of the gallstone or surgery to remove the gallbladder and repair the fistula between the gallbladder and the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
