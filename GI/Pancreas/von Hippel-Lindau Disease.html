            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is a genetic disorder that can cause tumors and cysts to develop in various parts of the body, including the brain, spinal cord, kidneys, and adrenal glands. Symptoms vary depending on the location of the tumors.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>VHL disease is rare, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 36,000 live births. It affects males and females equally.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>VHL disease is caused by mutations in the VHL gene, which is responsible for controlling cell growth and division. Mutations in this gene lead to the uncontrolled growth of tumors and cysts.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for VHL disease may include surgery to remove tumors and cysts, medication to manage symptoms, and regular monitoring to detect and treat new tumors early.</p>
