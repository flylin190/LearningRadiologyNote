            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most serous cystic neoplasms are asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Larger lesions may cause abdominal pain or discomfort.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Serous cystic neoplasms account for approximately 16-32% of all pancreatic cystic lesions and are more common in elderly women.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Serous cystic neoplasms are benign cystic lesions composed of glycogen-rich cuboidal epithelial cells that produce a watery, non-mucinous fluid. They are typically encapsulated and do not have malignant potential.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most serous cystic neoplasms do not require treatment, as they are benign lesions. However, surgical resection may be considered for larger or symptomatic lesions.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multilocular cystic lesion with a honeycomb or microcystic appearance</li>
                <li>Well-defined, lobulated margins</li>
                <li>Calcifications may be present within the cyst walls</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mucinous cystic neoplasm</li>
                <li>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)</li>
