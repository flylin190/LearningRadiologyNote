    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Mucinous cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are often asymptomatic, but larger lesions may cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Mucinous cystic neoplasms account for around 2-5% of all pancreatic cystic lesions and predominantly affect middle-aged to elderly women.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Mucinous cystic neoplasms are mucin-producing cystic neoplasms with a potential for malignant transformation. They are characterized by the presence of ovarian-type stroma and can progress from mucinous cystadenoma to mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for mucinous cystic neoplasms typically involves surgical resection, as these lesions have a significant malignant potential.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unilocular or multilocular cystic lesion</li>
                <li>Possible presence of internal septations or mural nodules</li>
                <li>Typically located in the body or tail of the pancreas</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Serous cystic neoplasm</li>
                <li>Pseudocyst</li>
                <li>Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)</li>
