    <h1>Wilson Disease</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of Wilson disease can vary and may include liver problems (e.g., hepatitis, cirrhosis), neurological symptoms (e.g., tremors, uncoordinated movements, personality changes), psychiatric symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety), and others like jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that affects copper metabolism, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 30,000 individuals worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Wilson disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which leads to an impaired ability to excrete excess copper from the body. Copper accumulates in various organs, particularly the liver and brain, leading to tissue damage and dysfunction.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Wilson disease involves chelation therapy with medications like penicillamine or trientine to remove excess copper from the body, and zinc salts to prevent further copper absorption. In severe cases, liver transplantation may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Liver involvement: Cirrhosis, fatty changes, or focal lesions</li>
                <li>Brain involvement: Symmetric basal ganglia hyperintensities on T1-weighted MRI (due to copper deposition)</li>
                <li>Other findings: Corneal copper deposition (Kayser-Fleischer rings), osteoporosis</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other causes of liver cirrhosis (e.g., viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease)</li>
                <li>Neurological disorders with basal ganglia involvement (e.g., Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease)</li>
                <li>Psychiatric disorders</li>
            </ul>
