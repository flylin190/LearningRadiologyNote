    <h1>SMA Syndrome</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Superior mesenteric artery (SMA) syndrome typically presents with abdominal pain, bloating, nausea, and vomiting. Patients may also experience weight loss due to poor nutritional intake.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>SMA syndrome is a rare condition that usually affects individuals with significant weight loss or a history of surgery, trauma, or prolonged bed rest.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>SMA syndrome is caused by compression of the duodenum between the superior mesenteric artery and the aorta, resulting in partial or complete obstruction of the duodenum.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for SMA syndrome aims to relieve the obstruction and improve nutritional intake. This may include dietary modifications, weight gain, and in severe cases, surgery to relieve the compression.</p>
