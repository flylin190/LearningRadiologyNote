    <h1>Hepatic Angiosarcoma</h1>
    <section class="content">

            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of hepatic angiosarcoma include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Abdominal pain or discomfort</li>
                <li>Weight loss</li>
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Jaundice (in advanced cases)</li>
            </p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hepatic angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive primary liver malignancy, accounting for approximately 2% of all primary liver cancers. It is more common in men and has a higher incidence in individuals with a history of exposure to certain chemicals or radiation.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Hepatic angiosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor arising from the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the liver. It is characterized by rapid growth and early metastasis, often to the lungs, bones, and lymph nodes.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment typically involves a multimodal approach, including surgical resection (if possible), chemotherapy, and/or radiation therapy. However, the prognosis for hepatic angiosarcoma is generally poor due to its aggressive nature and tendency for early metastasis.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Heterogeneous, ill-defined liver mass with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis</li>
                <li>Early and extensive metastatic disease (e.g., lung, bone, lymph nodes)</li>
                <li>Potential calcifications or hypervascularity within the tumor</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other primary liver malignancies (e.g., hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma)</li>
                <li>Metastatic disease to the liver</li>
                <li>Benign hepatic lesions (e.g., hemangioma, adenoma)</li>
            </ul>
