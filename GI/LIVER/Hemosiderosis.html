            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of hemosiderosis depend on the specific organs affected but may include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and chest pain. In severe cases, it can lead to organ failure.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hemosiderosis can occur at any age but is more common in adults. It is often associated with conditions such as chronic hemolytic anemia, chronic liver disease, and repeated blood transfusions.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Hemosiderosis is characterized by the accumulation of iron in tissues, particularly in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. This can lead to tissue damage and organ dysfunction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hemosiderosis may include iron chelation therapy to remove excess iron from the body and manage underlying conditions that contribute to iron overload.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI images due to iron deposition</li>
                <li>Enlargement of affected organs, such as the liver or spleen, on imaging</li>
            </ul>
