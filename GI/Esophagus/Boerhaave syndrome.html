    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The classic symptom of Boerhaave syndrome is sudden, severe chest pain often followed by vomiting and difficulty swallowing. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, fever, and chest tenderness.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Boerhaave syndrome is rare, accounting for only about 15% of esophageal perforations. It most commonly occurs in middle-aged men, often after episodes of excessive food or alcohol consumption.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Boerhaave syndrome is caused by a sudden increase in intra-esophageal pressure, leading to rupture of the esophageal wall. This most commonly occurs after forceful vomiting or retching.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for Boerhaave syndrome is surgical repair of the esophageal perforation. This is typically done through thoracotomy or thoracoscopy.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CT scan may show extraluminal air or contrast extravasation from the esophagus.</li>
                <li>Esophagography may demonstrate contrast extravasation into the mediastinum or pleural space.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Esophageal perforation due to other causes, such as trauma or instrumentation</li>
                <li>Esophageal rupture secondary to malignancy</li>
                <li>Spontaneous pneumomediastinum</li>
