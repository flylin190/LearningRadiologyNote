            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Feline esophagus, also known as esophageal dysmotility, is a condition characterized by abnormal movement and function of the esophagus. Symptoms may include regurgitation of food, difficulty swallowing, excessive salivation, and weight loss.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Feline esophagus can affect cats of all ages and breeds, but is more common in older cats. It may be associated with underlying conditions such as megaesophagus, esophageal strictures, or neurological disorders.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of feline esophagus is not fully understood, but it may involve dysfunction of the muscles and nerves that control esophageal movement. It can result in impaired peristalsis (wave-like contractions) and/or dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for feline esophagus depends on the underlying cause and severity of the condition. It may include dietary management, medications to improve esophageal motility, and supportive care such as feeding tubes.</p>
