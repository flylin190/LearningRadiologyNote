            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Gauzoma is a rare condition characterized by the presence of gauze or surgical sponge remnants within the body after surgery. Symptoms may vary depending on the location of the retained foreign body.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Incidence of gauzoma is low due to strict surgical protocols, but it can occur in any surgical procedure involving the use of surgical sponges or gauze.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The retained gauze or sponge can lead to a foreign body reaction, causing inflammation and potentially leading to abscess formation or other complications.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for gauzoma involves surgical removal of the retained foreign body. Antibiotics may be prescribed if infection is present.</p>
