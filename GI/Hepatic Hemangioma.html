            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hepatic hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic but may cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or a feeling of fullness if they are large enough to compress surrounding structures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hepatic hemangiomas are the most common benign liver tumors and are more common in women than men. They are often discovered incidentally during imaging studies for other conditions.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Hepatic hemangiomas are composed of clusters of blood vessels that can vary in size. They are typically well-defined and have a characteristic "scalloped" appearance on imaging.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most hepatic hemangiomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms or are at risk of rupture. In such cases, treatment options may include surgery, embolization, or radiofrequency ablation.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined hypervascular lesion on ultrasound</li>
                <li>Enhancing lesion on CT or MRI with characteristic "phleboliths" (calcifications within the lesion)</li>
