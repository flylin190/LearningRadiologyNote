    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Leriche syndrome presents with symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) involving the lower extremities, such as claudication, numbness, or weakness. It can progress to erectile dysfunction in men due to impaired blood flow to the pelvis.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Leriche syndrome is rare and most commonly affects men between the ages of 40 and 60. It is often associated with atherosclerosis.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Leriche syndrome is caused by occlusion or stenosis of the abdominal aorta, leading to insufficient blood flow to the lower extremities.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Leriche syndrome may include lifestyle modifications, medications to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, and in severe cases, surgical intervention to improve blood flow.</p>

                <li>CT angiography or MR angiography showing occlusion or stenosis of the abdominal aorta</li>
                <li>Decreased or absent pulses in the lower extremities</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Peripheral artery disease (PAD)</li>
                <li>Thromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger's disease)</li>
                <li>Arterial embolism</li>
