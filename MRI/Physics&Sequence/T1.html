            <h2>T1 Relaxation</h2>
            <p>T1 relaxation, also known as spin-lattice relaxation, is the process by which protons in the excited state release energy and return to their equilibrium state, realigning with the main magnetic field. The time constant that characterizes this process is called the T1 relaxation time.</p>

            <h2>T1 Weighting</h2>
            <p>T1-weighted images are designed to highlight differences in T1 relaxation times between various tissues. Tissues with shorter T1 relaxation times (e.g., fat) will appear brighter on T1-weighted images, while tissues with longer T1 relaxation times (e.g., fluids) will appear darker.</p>
            <p>T1-weighted sequences typically use a short repetition time (TR) and a short echo time (TE) to maximize the T1 contrast between different tissues.</p>

            <h2>Applications</h2>
            <p>T1-weighted images are particularly useful for imaging anatomy and detecting pathologies that involve fat or proteinaceous tissues. Some common applications include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anatomical imaging of the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system</li>
                <li>Detection of fatty lesions, such as lipomas or adrenal adenomas</li>
                <li>Evaluation of hemorrhagic lesions, which appear bright due to the presence of methemoglobin</li>
                <li>Assessment of enhancing lesions after the administration of gadolinium-based contrast agents</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
            <ul>
