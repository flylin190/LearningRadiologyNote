            <h2>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</h2>
            <p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is based on the principles of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). NMR is a phenomenon in which certain atomic nuclei, such as hydrogen protons, can absorb and emit radiofrequency (RF) energy when placed in a strong magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Spin and Precession</h2>
            <p>Protons have an inherent property called spin, which gives them a small magnetic moment. In the absence of an external magnetic field, these spins are randomly oriented. However, when a strong external magnetic field is applied, the spins align either parallel or anti-parallel to the field, with a slight preference for the lower energy parallel state.</p>
            <p>The spins precess, or wobble, around the direction of the applied magnetic field at a specific frequency known as the Larmor frequency, which is proportional to the strength of the magnetic field.</p>

            <h2>Radiofrequency Excitation and Relaxation</h2>
            <p>In MRI, a brief radiofrequency (RF) pulse is applied at the Larmor frequency, which causes the protons to absorb energy and transition to a higher energy state, temporarily disrupting their alignment with the main magnetic field. This process is known as excitation.</p>
            <p>After the RF pulse is turned off, the protons gradually release the absorbed energy and return to their equilibrium state, a process called relaxation. During relaxation, the protons emit RF signals that can be detected and used to create the MRI image.</p>
