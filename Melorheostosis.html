            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Melorheostosis is a rare bone disorder characterized by the thickening and overgrowth of the cortical bone. It can lead to pain, stiffness, and limited movement in the affected area.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Melorheostosis is a rare disease that can affect people of all ages. It is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of melorheostosis is unknown. It is believed to result from abnormal bone formation during development.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for melorheostosis aims to relieve symptoms and improve function. This may include physical therapy, pain management, and in severe cases, surgery to correct deformities or relieve pressure on nerves.</p>
