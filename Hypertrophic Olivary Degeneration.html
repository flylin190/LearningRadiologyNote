            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hypertrophic olivary degeneration (HOD) is a rare neurological condition that typically presents with palatal tremor, which is an involuntary rhythmic movement of the soft palate. Other symptoms may include ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>HOD is most commonly caused by a lesion or injury to the Guillain-Mollaret triangle, which is a neural pathway connecting the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum, the contralateral red nucleus, and the ipsilateral inferior olivary nucleus. The exact cause of this lesion can vary and may include stroke, trauma, or tumors.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>HOD is characterized by hypertrophy (enlargement) of the inferior olivary nucleus, which is a structure in the brainstem involved in motor coordination. This hypertrophy is believed to be a compensatory response to the loss of input from the cerebellum.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for HOD. Management typically focuses on addressing symptoms and may include medications to reduce tremor or physical therapy to improve coordination.</p>
