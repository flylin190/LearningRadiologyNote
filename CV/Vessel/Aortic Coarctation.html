    <h1>Coarctation of Aorta</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of aortic coarctation can vary depending on the severity and age of presentation. Common symptoms include hypertension, headaches, leg fatigue or claudication, and heart failure in severe cases.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Coarctation of the aorta is a congenital heart defect that occurs in approximately 1 in 2,500 live births. It is more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing or constriction of the aorta, typically located near the insertion of the ductus arteriosus just distal to the left subclavian artery. This obstruction causes increased blood pressure in the upper body and decreased blood flow to the lower body.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for coarctation of the aorta often involves surgical repair or interventional procedures, such as balloon angioplasty or stenting, to relieve the obstruction. The timing and approach depend on the severity of the coarctation and the presence of associated cardiac defects.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Narrowing or constriction of the aorta, typically in the aortic isthmus</li>
                <li>Post-stenotic dilation of the descending aorta</li>
                <li>Collateral vessels around the coarctation site</li>
                <li>Associated cardiac abnormalities (e.g., bicuspid aortic valve, ventricular septal defect)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Aortic hypoplasia</li>
                <li>Interrupted aortic arch</li>
                <li>Aortic dissection or aneurysm</li>
                <li>Extrinsic compression of the aorta</li>
            </ul>
