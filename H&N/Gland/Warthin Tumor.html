    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Warthin tumor is usually asymptomatic and is often discovered incidentally on imaging studies or physical examination. Rarely, it may cause pain or tenderness in the affected area.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Warthin tumor is more common in older adults, particularly in men. It is strongly associated with cigarette smoking.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Warthin tumor is a benign salivary gland tumor that typically occurs in the parotid gland. It is characterized by cystic spaces lined by epithelial and lymphoid cells.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Warthin tumor is usually treated with surgical removal. In most cases, the tumor is benign and does not recur after removal.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed, cystic lesion on imaging</li>
                <li>Enhancement of the cystic component with contrast</li>
                <li>Typically located in the parotid gland</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other salivary gland tumors</li>
                <li>Lymphadenopathy</li>
