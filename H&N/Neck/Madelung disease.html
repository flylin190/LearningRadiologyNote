            <h2>Description:</h2>
            <p>Madelung disease is a rare benign entity clinically characterized by the presence of multiple and symmetric, non-encapsulated masses of fatty tissue, usually involving the neck and the upper region of the trunk, mainly in the posterior aspect. Limb involvement is usually proximal and around the shoulder and hip girdles.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Madelung disease is a rare condition that typically presents in adolescence and is more common in males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Madelung disease is unknown, but it is thought to be related to abnormal growth of fatty tissue.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Madelung disease may include surgical removal of the fatty masses for cosmetic reasons or if they cause symptoms such as compression of nearby structures.</p>
