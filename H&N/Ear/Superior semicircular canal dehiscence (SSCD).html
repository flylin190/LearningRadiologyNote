    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of SSCD include vertigo (often triggered by loud noises or changes in middle ear pressure), hearing loss, autophony (hearing one's own voice or internal sounds unusually loudly), and a pulsatile tinnitus (hearing a rhythmic noise in the ear).</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>SSCD is a rare condition that can affect people of all ages. It is more common in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>SSCD is characterized by a thinning or absence of the bone covering the superior semicircular canal of the inner ear, leading to abnormal communication between the inner ear and the cranial cavity.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for SSCD is surgical repair of the dehiscence, which involves patching or plugging the hole in the bone covering the superior semicircular canal. This surgery can help alleviate symptoms in many cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>CT scan or high-resolution CT (HRCT) scan may show thinning or absence of the bone overlying the superior semicircular canal.</li>
                <li>MRI may be used to rule out other causes of symptoms, such as a brain tumor.</li>
            </ul>
