            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Cholesterol granulomas are often asymptomatic but can present with symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, or facial nerve weakness if they impinge on nearby structures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cholesterol granulomas most commonly occur in the middle ear and are often associated with chronic otitis media with effusion. They are more common in males and typically affect adults.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cholesterol granulomas result from chronic inflammation caused by the presence of cholesterol crystals, usually in response to chronic bleeding and tissue breakdown. The inflammatory response leads to the formation of a granulomatous reaction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment of cholesterol granulomas depends on their size and location. Small, asymptomatic granulomas may not require treatment. Symptomatic granulomas may be treated with surgical drainage or removal.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cholesterol granulomas typically appear as well-defined, cystic lesions with a hyperintense rim on T1-weighted MRI.</li>
                <li>On CT scan, they often present as hyperdense lesions with central hypodensity.</li>
            </ul>
