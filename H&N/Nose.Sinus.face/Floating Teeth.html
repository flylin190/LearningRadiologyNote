            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Floating teeth is a term used to describe the loosening or loss of teeth due to periodontal disease or other dental issues. Symptoms may include gum inflammation, bleeding gums, bad breath, and tooth sensitivity.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Periodontal disease is common in both humans and animals, including cats and dogs. It can affect pets of all ages, but is more common in older animals.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Periodontal disease is caused by bacteria in dental plaque, which can lead to inflammation and infection of the gums (gingivitis) and surrounding structures (periodontitis). Without treatment, it can result in loss of teeth and damage to the jawbone.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for periodontal disease in pets may include dental cleanings, tooth extractions, and antibiotics to control bacterial infection. Regular dental care at home, such as tooth brushing and dental chews, can also help prevent periodontal disease.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>X-ray may show loss of bone around the teeth</li>
                <li>Loose or missing teeth on dental radiographs</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>

                <li>Malocclusion (misalignment of the teeth)</li>
                <li>Oral tumors</li>
