    <h1>Dentigerous Cyst</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Dentigerous cysts are often asymptomatic and are usually discovered during routine dental exams. Symptoms may include swelling, pain, or infection if the cyst becomes large or infected.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Dentigerous cysts are most commonly seen in young adults and are associated with impacted, unerupted teeth, most commonly the mandibular third molars.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Dentigerous cysts develop from the accumulation of fluid between the crown of an unerupted tooth and the surrounding dental follicle.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for dentigerous cysts typically involves surgical removal of the cyst and any associated impacted teeth.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined radiolucent lesion around the crown of an unerupted tooth on dental radiographs</li>
                <li>May cause displacement of adjacent teeth</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Odontogenic keratocyst</li>
                <li>Ameloblastoma</li>
                <li>Calcifying odontogenic cyst</li>
