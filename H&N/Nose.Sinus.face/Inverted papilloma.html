            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Inverted papilloma often presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and sinusitis symptoms. It may also be associated with anosmia and facial pain or pressure.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Inverted papilloma is a rare benign tumor that most commonly affects adults in their 5th to 7th decades of life. It is more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Inverted papilloma is characterized by its endophytic growth pattern, with epithelial invaginations into the underlying stroma. It is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for inverted papilloma is surgical resection. Endoscopic sinus surgery is often used to remove the tumor and affected mucosa. Recurrence rates are low, but regular follow-up is recommended.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enhancing soft tissue mass in the sinonasal cavity on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Bone erosion or remodeling of the sinonasal structures</li>
                <li>May be associated with air-fluid levels or sinus opacification</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Antrochoanal polyp</li>
                <li>Benign sinonasal tumors (e.g., nasal polyps)</li>
                <li>Malignant sinonasal tumors (e.g., squamous cell carcinoma)</li>
