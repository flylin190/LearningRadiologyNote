        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Kimura disease typically presents with painless swelling in the head and neck region, most commonly involving the lymph nodes. It can also cause skin lesions and allergic reactions.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Kimura disease is more common in Asian males, typically in their 20s and 30s. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be related to an abnormal immune response.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Kimura disease is characterized by the presence of eosinophilic infiltrates in the affected tissues, including the lymph nodes and salivary glands.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Kimura disease may include corticosteroids to reduce inflammation, and in some cases, surgery to remove the affected lymph nodes or lesions.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Enlarged lymph nodes on imaging</li>
                <li>Enhancement of affected lymph nodes with contrast</li>
                <li>Soft tissue involvement in the head and neck region</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lymphadenopathy due to other causes (e.g., infection, malignancy)</li>
                <li>Salivary gland tumors</li>
