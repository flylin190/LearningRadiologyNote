    <section class="content">

            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Zinner syndrome is typically asymptomatic, but symptoms may include recurrent urinary tract infections, pelvic pain, or infertility in males.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Zinner syndrome is a rare congenital anomaly, with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 100,000 individuals. It is more common in males.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Zinner syndrome is characterized by the triad of unilateral renal agenesis (absence of one kidney), ipsilateral seminal vesicle cyst, and an obstructive lesion of the ejaculatory duct.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment is typically not required unless the patient is symptomatic. In such cases, surgical removal of the seminal vesicle cyst or transurethral resection of the ejaculatory duct obstruction may be performed.</p>

                <li>Unilateral renal agenesis</li>
                <li>Seminal vesicle cyst on the same side as the absent kidney</li>
                <li>Dilated or obstructed ejaculatory duct</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>MÃ¼llerian duct cyst</li>
                <li>Prostatic utricle cyst</li>
