            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Yolk sac tumor may present with abdominal pain, bloating, a palpable mass in the abdomen, weight loss, and symptoms related to metastasis, such as respiratory symptoms if the tumor has spread to the lungs.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Yolk sac tumor is a type of germ cell tumor that most commonly occurs in children and young adults. It is the most common testicular tumor in infants and young boys.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The pathology of yolk sac tumor involves the presence of yolk sac-like structures, which are characteristic on histological examination. Elevated levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are also typical.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for yolk sac tumor usually involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used.</p>
