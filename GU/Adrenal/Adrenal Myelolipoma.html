            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Adrenal myelolipomas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, in some cases, they may cause abdominal or flank pain.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Adrenal myelolipomas are rare benign tumors that occur most commonly in adults between the ages of 40 and 60 years old.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Adrenal myelolipomas are composed of mature adipose tissue and hematopoietic elements, such as myeloid cells, erythrocytes, and megakaryocytes.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most adrenal myelolipomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms or are large in size. Surgical removal may be considered in these cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed mass with fat density on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Presence of hematopoietic elements, which may appear hyperdense on imaging</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Adrenal adenoma</li>
                <li>Adrenal carcinoma</li>
