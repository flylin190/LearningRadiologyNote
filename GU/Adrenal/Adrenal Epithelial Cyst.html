    <h1>Adrenal Epithelial Cyst</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most adrenal cysts are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally during imaging studies for other conditions. However, large cysts may cause abdominal or flank pain, and cysts that cause hormonal imbalances may lead to symptoms such as hypertension or hypokalemia.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Adrenal cysts are rare and are more common in women than men. They can occur at any age but are most commonly found in middle-aged adults.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Adrenal epithelial cysts are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells and contain clear or straw-colored fluid. The exact cause of these cysts is unknown, but they are thought to arise from embryonic remnants or as a result of cystic degeneration of adrenal tumors.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Small asymptomatic adrenal cysts usually do not require treatment. Larger symptomatic cysts may be drained or surgically removed, especially if they are causing hormonal imbalances or compression of nearby structures.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined round or oval cystic lesion in the adrenal gland on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Fluid density or signal intensity within the cyst</li>
                <li>No enhancement on postcontrast imaging</li>
            </ul>
