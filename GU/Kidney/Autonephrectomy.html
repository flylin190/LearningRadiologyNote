            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Autonephrectomy is a rare condition where a kidney undergoes self-destruction and is eventually replaced by fibrous tissue. This process is usually asymptomatic, but in some cases, it can cause flank pain or hematuria.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Autonephrectomy is extremely rare and can occur at any age, but it is most commonly seen in older adults.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of autonephrectomy is unknown, but it is believed to be associated with chronic inflammation or obstruction of the kidney.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for autonephrectomy, as it is a rare and usually asymptomatic condition. In cases where symptoms occur, supportive care may be provided.</p>
