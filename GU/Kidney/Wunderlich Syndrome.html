    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The main symptom of Wunderlich syndrome is acute and severe flank pain, often accompanied by symptoms of hypovolemic shock, such as dizziness, nausea, and tachycardia.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Wunderlich syndrome, also known as spontaneous renal hemorrhage, is a rare condition that can occur in patients with renal tumors, vascular malformations, or other underlying renal pathologies.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Wunderlich syndrome is characterized by spontaneous, non-traumatic bleeding into the subcapsular and perirenal spaces of the kidney, typically due to rupture of a renal tumor or vascular malformation.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment depends on the severity of the bleeding and the underlying cause. In acute cases, immediate management may include fluid resuscitation, blood transfusions, and embolization or surgical intervention to control the bleeding. Definitive treatment often involves surgical resection of the underlying renal lesion.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Perirenal and subcapsular hematoma on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Active extravasation of contrast material in acute bleeding</li>
                <li>Underlying renal mass or vascular malformation may be identified</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Renal trauma</li>
                <li>Renal artery aneurysm rupture</li>
                <li>Renal cyst hemorrhage</li>
