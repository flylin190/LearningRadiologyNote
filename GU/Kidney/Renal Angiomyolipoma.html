            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Renal angiomyolipomas are often asymptomatic and are usually discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, larger tumors may cause pain or bleeding.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Renal angiomyolipomas are most commonly found in middle-aged women and are often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC).</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Renal angiomyolipomas are benign tumors composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat cells.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for renal angiomyolipoma depends on the size of the tumor and the presence of symptoms. Small asymptomatic tumors may be monitored, while larger tumors or those causing symptoms may require surgical removal.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Presence of fat within the tumor on CT scan (characteristic feature)</li>
                <li>Enhancement of the tumor's soft tissue components on imaging</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Renal cell carcinoma</li>
                <li>Angiomyolipoma with minimal fat</li>
                <li>Cystic renal cell carcinoma</li>
