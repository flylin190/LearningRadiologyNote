    <h1>Nutcracker Syndrome</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of nutcracker syndrome include pelvic pain, hematuria (blood in urine), proteinuria (protein in urine), and gonadal vein varices in severe cases.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Nutcracker syndrome is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 0.6-0.7%. It can occur in both children and adults, with a higher incidence in females.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Nutcracker syndrome is caused by compression of the left renal vein between the abdominal aorta and the superior mesenteric artery, leading to impaired venous outflow and subsequent development of collateral vessels and varices.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for nutcracker syndrome include conservative management with pain medication, percutaneous endovascular stenting of the left renal vein, or open surgical procedures such as nephropexy (kidney suspension) or transposition of the left renal vein.</p>
