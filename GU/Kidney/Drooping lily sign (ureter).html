            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The drooping lily sign in the ureter refers to the radiological appearance of a ureteral mass with a central necrotic area surrounded by an enhancing rim, resembling a drooping lily. Patients may present with symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and urinary obstruction.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Ureteral masses are relatively uncommon and can be benign or malignant. They may arise from the ureteral wall or adjacent structures such as the bladder, kidney, or reproductive organs.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The pathology of ureteral masses varies depending on the underlying cause. Benign masses may include ureteral polyps, fibroepithelial polyps, or leiomyomas, while malignant masses may include ureteral carcinoma or metastatic disease.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment of ureteral masses depends on the underlying pathology and may include surgical resection, endoscopic removal, or systemic therapy for metastatic disease. Ureteral stenting may be required for urinary obstruction.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Central necrotic area within a ureteral mass on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Enhancing rim around the necrotic area, resembling a drooping lily</li>
                <li>May be associated with hydronephrosis or hydroureter</li>
