            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Vesicoureteric reflux (VUR) is a condition where urine flows backward from the bladder into the ureters or kidneys. It is often asymptomatic but can lead to urinary tract infections, kidney damage, and other complications.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>VUR is relatively common in children, especially infants and young children. It is more common in girls than boys.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>VUR is typically caused by a defect in the valve-like mechanism where the ureters enter the bladder, allowing urine to flow backward. It can be primary (congenital) or secondary (acquired).</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for VUR depends on the severity and symptoms. It may include medications to prevent urinary tract infections, surgery to correct the defect, or watchful waiting in mild cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dilated ureters and/or renal pelvis on ultrasound</li>
                <li>Reflux of contrast into the ureters or kidneys on voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ureteropelvic junction obstruction</li>
                <li>Bladder outlet obstruction</li>
                <li>Prune belly syndrome</li>
