            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Neurogenic bladder is characterized by dysfunction of the urinary bladder due to a neurologic condition, such as spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or stroke. Symptoms may include urinary incontinence, urinary retention, and frequent urinary tract infections.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Neurogenic bladder can occur at any age but is more common in older adults and individuals with neurologic conditions.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Neurogenic bladder is caused by damage to the nerves that control bladder function, leading to abnormal bladder contractions or inability to empty the bladder completely.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for neurogenic bladder depends on the underlying cause and may include medications, catheterization, and surgery to repair nerve damage or improve bladder function.</p>
