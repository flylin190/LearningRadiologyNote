    <h1>Urachal Adenocarcinoma</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of urachal adenocarcinoma can include abdominal pain, hematuria (blood in the urine), mucosuria (mucus in the urine), and a palpable abdominal mass.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Urachal adenocarcinoma is a rare malignant tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all bladder cancers. It can occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in adults between the ages of 40 and 70.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Urachal adenocarcinoma arises from the remnants of the urachus, a fibrous cord that connects the bladder to the umbilicus during fetal development. It is typically an adenocarcinoma, but other histological types can also occur.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for urachal adenocarcinoma typically involves surgical resection of the tumor and the urachus, as well as partial or radical cystectomy (removal of the bladder) depending on the extent of the disease. Adjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be recommended in some cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Midline supravesical mass, often with calcifications</li>
                <li>Invasion or involvement of the bladder dome</li>
                <li>Possible extension along the urachus toward the umbilicus</li>
                <li>Lymph node enlargement or metastases in advanced cases</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Urachal cyst or remnant</li>
                <li>Bladder cancer</li>
                <li>Metastatic lesions</li>
                <li>Other primary tumors of the bladder or pelvis</li>
            </ul>
