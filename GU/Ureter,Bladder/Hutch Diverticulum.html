            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hutch diverticulum of the urinary bladder is often asymptomatic but may present with symptoms such as recurrent urinary tract infections, hematuria, or lower abdominal pain. In rare cases, it may be associated with bladder outlet obstruction.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hutch diverticulum of the urinary bladder is a rare congenital anomaly that is more commonly found in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Hutch diverticulum of the urinary bladder results from a weakness in the bladder wall, leading to outpouching of the mucosa and submucosa. It is typically located at the bladder neck or ureteral orifice.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Asymptomatic Hutch diverticula do not require treatment. Symptomatic cases may be managed conservatively with antibiotics for urinary tract infections and surgical resection in cases of significant symptoms or complications.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Outpouching of the bladder wall on cystography or voiding cystourethrography</li>
                <li>Ultrasound can visualize the diverticulum and assess for associated complications</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bladder diverticulum from other causes</li>
                <li>Bladder carcinoma</li>
                <li>Bladder calculus</li>
