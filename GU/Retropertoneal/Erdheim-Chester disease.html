            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) is a rare form of non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis. It commonly presents with bone pain, especially in the long bones, and can also affect the skin, heart, lungs, and other organs.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>ECD is extremely rare, with fewer than 500 cases reported in the medical literature. It typically affects adults, with an average age of onset in the fifth to sixth decade of life.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>ECD is characterized by the infiltration of tissues by lipid-laden macrophages, leading to the formation of granulomas. The exact cause of ECD is unknown.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for ECD depends on the extent and severity of the disease. It may include medications to reduce inflammation, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs, or targeted therapies that inhibit specific pathways involved in the disease process.</p>
