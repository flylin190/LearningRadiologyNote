            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Patients with a calcaneonavicular coalition may experience foot pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion, particularly during physical activity. The symptoms often worsen over time.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Calcaneonavicular coalitions are relatively rare, occurring in approximately 1-2% of the population. They can be congenital or acquired and may be bilateral in some cases.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A calcaneonavicular coalition is an abnormal fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony union between the calcaneus (heel bone) and the navicular bone in the midfoot. This union restricts normal motion and can lead to increased stress and pain.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for calcaneonavicular coalitions may include conservative measures, such as activity modification, orthotics, and anti-inflammatory medications. In severe or refractory cases, surgical resection of the coalition may be considered.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abnormal bony or fibrous connection between the calcaneus and navicular bones</li>
                <li>Potential narrowing or obliteration of the calcaneonavicular joint space</li>
                <li>Associated degenerative changes or subchondral cyst formation</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tarsal coalition (e.g., calcaneonavicular, talonavicular)</li>
                <li>Degenerative joint disease or arthritis</li>
                <li>Inflammatory arthropathy</li>
