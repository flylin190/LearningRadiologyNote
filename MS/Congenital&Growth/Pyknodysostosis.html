            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Pyknodysostosis is characterized by short stature, brittle bones, and abnormalities of the skull and facial bones. Individuals with pyknodysostosis may also have delayed tooth eruption and dental abnormalities.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pyknodysostosis is a rare genetic disorder that is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. It is more common in certain populations, such as those of Mediterranean or African descent.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pyknodysostosis is caused by mutations in the gene that encodes the enzyme cathepsin K, which is involved in bone remodeling. These mutations result in abnormal bone development and increased bone density.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for pyknodysostosis is supportive and aims to manage symptoms. This may include fracture management, dental care, and physical therapy.</p>
