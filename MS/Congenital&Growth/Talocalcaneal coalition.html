            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The most common symptom is foot pain, which may be accompanied by stiffness, flatfoot deformity, and limited range of motion in the subtalar joint.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Talocalcaneal coalitions are relatively rare, occurring in approximately 1% of the population. They are often present at birth (congenital) but may also develop later in life (acquired).</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A talocalcaneal coalition is an abnormal fibrous, cartilaginous, or bony union between the talus and calcaneus bones in the hindfoot. This union limits the normal motion between these bones, leading to increased stress and potential deformity.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options depend on the severity of symptoms and the type of coalition. Conservative treatment, such as immobilization, physical therapy, and the use of orthotics, may be recommended initially. In more severe cases, surgical resection of the coalition or arthrodesis (fusion) of the affected joint may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Abnormal bony, cartilaginous, or fibrous union between the talus and calcaneus</li>
                <li>Limited subtalar joint motion</li>
                <li>Potential flatfoot deformity</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tarsal coalition (e.g., calcaneonavicular coalition)</li>
                <li>Subtalar joint arthritis</li>
                <li>Accessory ossicles or fractures</li>
