            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Sacral agenesis may present with a variety of symptoms depending on the severity of the condition. Common symptoms include lower back pain, leg weakness, sensory deficits, and bowel and bladder dysfunction.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Sacral agenesis is a rare congenital condition that affects the development of the sacrum, the triangular bone at the base of the spine. It is more common in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Sacral agenesis results from abnormal development of the caudal portion of the embryo during early pregnancy. It can occur sporadically or be associated with genetic syndromes such as VACTERL association.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for sacral agenesis focuses on managing symptoms and improving quality of life. This may include physical therapy, assistive devices, and surgical interventions to address specific complications.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Absence or underdevelopment of the sacrum on radiographs</li>
                <li>Malformations of adjacent vertebrae</li>
                <li>Associated anomalies such as spinal dysraphism or lower limb abnormalities</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Caudal regression syndrome</li>
                <li>Sacral dysgenesis</li>
