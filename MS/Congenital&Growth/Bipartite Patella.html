            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Bipartite patella typically presents with anterior knee pain, especially with activities that require bending of the knee. Swelling and tenderness over the bipartite fragment may also be present.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Bipartite patella is a relatively rare condition that is more common in males and often affects individuals between the ages of 10 and 20 years.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Bipartite patella is a congenital condition characterized by the failure of the patella to fuse during childhood, resulting in a bipartite (two-part) patella.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for bipartite patella is usually conservative and may include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bipartite fragment.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Radiographs typically show a well-defined, corticated fragment of bone adjacent to the superolateral aspect of the patella</li>
                <li>CT or MRI may be used to further evaluate the fragment and assess for any associated pathology</li>
