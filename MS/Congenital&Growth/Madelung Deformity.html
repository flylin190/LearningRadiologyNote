            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Medelung deformity is characterized by bilateral wrist deformity, usually with volar subluxation of the distal ulna, leading to a prominent ulnar head and shortened ulna. Patients may also experience wrist pain and limited range of motion.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Medelung deformity is a rare condition that typically presents in adolescence and is more common in females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Medelung deformity is unknown, but it is thought to be related to abnormal growth of the ulnar physis during development.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Medelung deformity may include conservative measures such as splinting and physical therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be required to correct the deformity.</p>
