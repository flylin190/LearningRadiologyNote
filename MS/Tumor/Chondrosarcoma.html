            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Chondroblastoma typically presents with localized pain and swelling in the affected bone. It is more common in younger individuals and often affects the long bones of the extremities.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Chondroblastoma is a rare bone tumor that usually occurs in children and young adults. It accounts for approximately 1% of all primary bone tumors.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Chondroblastoma is characterized by the presence of chondroblasts, which are large, polygonal cells with eccentric nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor is typically well-circumscribed and may show areas of calcification and hemorrhage.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for chondroblastoma usually involves surgical resection of the tumor. In some cases, curettage (scraping) of the tumor may be sufficient. Radiation therapy is generally not used due to the risk of malignant transformation.</p>
