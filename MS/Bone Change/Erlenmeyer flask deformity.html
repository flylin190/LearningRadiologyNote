            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Erlenmeyer flask deformity is a radiological term used to describe the appearance of the distal femur, which resembles the shape of an Erlenmeyer flask. It is often associated with certain bone dysplasias, such as Gaucher disease.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Erlenmeyer flask deformity is typically seen in individuals with metabolic bone disorders, such as Gaucher disease, and other conditions affecting bone metabolism.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The deformity is thought to result from abnormal bone remodeling and deposition of marrow constituents within the bone, leading to a characteristic appearance on imaging studies.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Erlenmeyer flask deformity depends on the underlying cause. In cases associated with metabolic bone disorders, treatment may involve enzyme replacement therapy and management of associated complications.</p>
