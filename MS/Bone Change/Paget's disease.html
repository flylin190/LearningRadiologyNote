            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most people with Paget's disease of bone have no symptoms. However, some may experience bone pain, joint pain, and deformities.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Paget's disease of bone is more common in older adults, and its prevalence increases with age. It is more common in men than women.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Paget's disease is characterized by excessive bone remodeling, leading to enlarged and weakened bones.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Paget's disease may include medications to reduce bone turnover, such as bisphosphonates, and in some cases, surgery to correct deformities or repair fractures.</p>
