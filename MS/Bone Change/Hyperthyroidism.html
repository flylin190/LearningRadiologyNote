            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hyperthyroidism of bone is often asymptomatic but may present with bone pain, fractures, or deformities in severe cases.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hyperthyroidism of bone is associated with hyperthyroidism, a condition characterized by excessive production of thyroid hormones. It is more common in women and typically occurs in middle-aged or older individuals.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Hyperthyroidism of bone is caused by the effects of excess thyroid hormones on bone metabolism, leading to increased bone resorption and decreased bone formation.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hyperthyroidism of bone aims to normalize thyroid hormone levels and prevent further bone loss. This may include medication to regulate thyroid function, such as antithyroid drugs or thyroid hormone replacement therapy.</p>
