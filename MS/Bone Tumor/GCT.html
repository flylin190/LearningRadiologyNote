            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of giant cell tumor of bone include localized pain, swelling, and, in some cases, a palpable mass at the affected site. If the tumor involves a joint, it may cause limited range of motion.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Giant cell tumor of bone is a relatively rare tumor that usually occurs in adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. It is more common in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Giant cell tumor of bone is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells in a background of mononuclear stromal cells. It typically occurs in the epiphysis of long bones, such as the distal femur, proximal tibia, and distal radius.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for giant cell tumor of bone depends on the size and location of the tumor. Options may include curettage (scraping out the tumor), bone grafting, and in some cases, adjuvant therapy such as denosumab.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Eccentric, lytic lesion with well-defined margins on X-ray</li>
                <li>Typically involves the epiphysis of long bones</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Aneurysmal bone cyst</li>
                <li>Chondroblastoma</li>
