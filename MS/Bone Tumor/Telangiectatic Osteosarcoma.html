            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of telangiectatic osteosarcoma may include bone pain, swelling, and in some cases, pathological fractures.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is a rare subtype of osteosarcoma, accounting for approximately 3-5% of all osteosarcoma cases. It typically affects older adults, with a peak incidence in the second and third decades of life.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Telangiectatic osteosarcoma is characterized by a highly vascular tumor with large, dilated blood-filled spaces and areas of necrosis. It is an aggressive form of osteosarcoma and has a higher risk of metastasis compared to other subtypes.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and surgical resection, followed by additional chemotherapy. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used as part of the treatment regimen.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lytic, destructive bone lesion with a "moth-eaten" appearance on X-ray</li>
                <li>Heterogeneous signal intensity with fluid-fluid levels on MRI</li>
                <li>Marked enhancement and surrounding edema on contrast-enhanced MRI or CT</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other subtypes of osteosarcoma (e.g., conventional, chondroblastic)</li>
                <li>Aneurysmal bone cyst</li>
                <li>Bone metastases</li>
            </ul>
