        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Aneurysmal bone cysts may present with pain, swelling, and limited range of motion in the affected area. Fractures may also occur due to the weakened bone.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Aneurysmal bone cysts are more common in children and adolescents, and they occur more frequently in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign bone tumors that are characterized by cystic spaces filled with blood. The exact cause is unknown, but they may be related to vascular malformations or previous trauma.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for aneurysmal bone cysts may include surgical removal of the cyst, curettage (scraping out the cyst contents), and bone grafting to fill the defect.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cystic lesion with fluid-fluid levels on MRI</li>
                <li>Expansile, eccentrically located lytic lesion on X-ray</li>
                <li>Well-defined borders with cortical thinning and no periosteal reaction</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Unicameral bone cyst</li>
                <li>Simple bone cyst</li>
