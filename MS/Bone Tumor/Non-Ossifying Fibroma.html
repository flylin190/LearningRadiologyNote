            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Non-ossifying fibromas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Non-ossifying fibromas are most commonly found in children and adolescents, with a peak incidence in the second decade of life. They are more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Non-ossifying fibromas are benign fibrous lesions that occur in the metaphysis of long bones, most commonly the distal femur and proximal tibia. They are thought to represent a reactive process to minor trauma.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Non-ossifying fibromas typically do not require treatment unless they cause symptoms or are at risk for fracture. In such cases, surgical curettage may be performed.</p>

                <li>Lesion may exhibit sclerotic borders</li>
