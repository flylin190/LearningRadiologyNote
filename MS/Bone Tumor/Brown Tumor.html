    <h1>Brown Tumor</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Brown tumors are often asymptomatic, but they can cause bone pain, swelling, or fractures if they grow large enough to affect the surrounding structures.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Brown tumors are a manifestation of hyperparathyroidism, which can be primary (due to parathyroid gland dysfunction) or secondary (due to chronic kidney disease or vitamin D deficiency).</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Brown tumors are non-neoplastic lesions that occur due to excessive osteoclastic activity and bone resorption caused by high levels of parathyroid hormone. They are called "brown" because of their rich vascularity and the presence of hemosiderin deposits.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment focuses on addressing the underlying cause of hyperparathyroidism, such as surgical removal of the parathyroid adenoma or correction of vitamin D deficiency. In some cases, surgical removal or curettage of large brown tumors may be necessary to prevent complications.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Expansile, lytic bone lesions with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance</li>
                <li>Frequently involve the ribs, jaw, and pelvis</li>
                <li>May show a thin, sclerotic rim or periosteal reaction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Giant cell tumor</li>
                <li>Aneurysmal bone cyst</li>
                <li>Metastatic disease</li>
            </ul>
