            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The main symptom of osteoid osteoma is severe, localized pain that is often worse at night and relieved by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The affected area may also be tender and have slight swelling.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoid osteoma is a relatively uncommon benign bone tumor that typically affects individuals between the ages of 5 and 25 years, with a male predominance. It accounts for approximately 3% of all primary bone tumors.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone-forming tumor characterized by a central nidus (a core of vascular osteoid tissue) surrounded by a highly vascularized and reactive bone formation.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment of choice for osteoid osteoma is surgical removal of the nidus, which can provide complete relief of symptoms. This can be achieved through various surgical techniques, such as open surgery, percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, or CT-guided ablation.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Small, well-defined lytic lesion with a central nidus (typically less than 1.5 cm)</li>
                <li>Surrounding sclerotic bone reaction</li>
                <li>Intense perifocal bone marrow and soft tissue edema</li>
                <li>Double density sign on CT (central nidus surrounded by a dense sclerotic rim)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteoblastoma</li>
                <li>Osteomyelitis</li>
                <li>Stress fracture</li>
                <li>Benign bone tumors (e.g., chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia)</li>
            </ul>
