            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hereditary multiple exostoses is a genetic disorder characterized by the formation of multiple benign bone tumors called osteochondromas. These tumors typically develop near the ends of long bones, such as the arms and legs, and can cause pain, deformity, and restricted movement.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hereditary multiple exostoses is a rare condition that affects approximately 1 in 50,000 people. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, meaning that a person only needs to inherit one copy of the defective gene to develop the condition.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The underlying genetic defect in hereditary multiple exostoses is a mutation in either the EXT1 or EXT2 gene, which are involved in the regulation of bone growth. This mutation leads to the formation of osteochondromas.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hereditary multiple exostoses depends on the symptoms and complications. It may include surgery to remove painful or deforming osteochondromas, physical therapy to improve range of motion, and monitoring for potential complications such as malignant transformation of osteochondromas.</p>
