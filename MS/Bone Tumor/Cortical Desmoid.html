            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Cortical desmoids are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Rarely, they may present with pain or swelling in the affected bone.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cortical desmoids are rare benign lesions that can occur at any age, with a slight male predominance.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cortical desmoids are fibrous cortical defects that are thought to result from a reactive process rather than a true neoplasm.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most cortical desmoids do not require treatment and are managed conservatively with observation. Surgical excision may be considered in cases of symptomatic lesions or those at risk for fracture.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed radiolucent lesion with sclerotic margins on X-ray</li>
                <li>Typically located in the cortex of long bones</li>
                <li>No periosteal reaction or soft tissue mass</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fibrous dysplasia</li>
                <li>Simple bone cyst</li>
                <li>Nonossifying fibroma</li>
