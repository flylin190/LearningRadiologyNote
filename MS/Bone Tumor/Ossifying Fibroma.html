            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Ossifying fibromas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Ossifying fibromas most commonly occur in young adults, with a peak incidence in the third decade of life. They are more common in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Ossifying fibromas are benign fibro-osseous lesions that most commonly occur in the mandible and maxilla. They consist of fibrous tissue with varying amounts of calcified material.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Small ossifying fibromas may not require treatment. Larger lesions or those causing symptoms may be treated with surgical excision.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, radiopaque lesion in the mandible or maxilla on X-ray</li>
                <li>Lesion may exhibit a "ground glass" appearance</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
