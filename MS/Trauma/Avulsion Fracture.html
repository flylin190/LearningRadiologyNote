    <h1>Avulsion Fracture</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of an avulsion fracture include pain, swelling, and limited range of motion at the affected joint or area. Bruising may also be present.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Avulsion fractures can occur in people of any age but are more common in children and adolescents due to the relative weakness of the growth plates compared to the strength of tendons and ligaments.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>An avulsion fracture occurs when a tendon or ligament pulls off a small piece of bone from its attachment site, due to sudden forceful muscle contraction or trauma.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for avulsion fractures include immobilization with a cast or splint, pain management, and in some cases, surgical fixation of the bone fragment if it is significantly displaced.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Small bone fragment avulsed from its attachment site on X-ray or CT scan</li>
                <li>Soft tissue swelling at the site of injury</li>
                <li>Associated tendon or ligament injury may be visible on MRI</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tendon or ligament strain/tear</li>
                <li>Muscle strain</li>
                <li>Joint dislocation</li>
            </ul>
