    <h1>Patellar Tendon-Lateral Femoral Condyle Friction Syndrome</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The main symptom is lateral knee pain, which is exacerbated by activities that increase friction between the patellar tendon and the lateral femoral condyle, such as squatting, kneeling, and stair climbing.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>This condition is relatively uncommon and is most frequently seen in physically active individuals, particularly those involved in sports that require repetitive knee flexion and extension.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Patellar tendon-lateral femoral condyle friction syndrome is caused by repeated friction and impingement between the patellar tendon and the lateral femoral condyle during knee flexion and extension. This can lead to inflammation and degeneration of the patellar tendon.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment typically involves conservative measures such as activity modification, physical therapy, and the use of patellar tendon straps or braces to reduce friction. In severe cases, surgical intervention may be required to release the patellar tendon or reshape the lateral femoral condyle.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Thickening or irregularity of the patellar tendon</li>
                <li>Edema or signal changes in the patellar tendon</li>
                <li>Bony irregularity or spur formation on the lateral femoral condyle</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Patellar tendinopathy</li>
                <li>Iliotibial band syndrome</li>
                <li>Lateral meniscus tear</li>
