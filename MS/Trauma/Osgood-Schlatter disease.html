            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osgood-Schlatter disease typically presents with knee pain and swelling, especially during physical activities such as running or jumping. The pain is usually located below the knee cap and may worsen with activity.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osgood-Schlatter disease most commonly affects adolescents who are going through growth spurts. It is more common in boys than girls.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osgood-Schlatter disease is caused by repetitive stress on the growth plate of the tibia, where the patellar tendon attaches. This stress can lead to inflammation, pain, and swelling.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Osgood-Schlatter disease focuses on relieving pain and reducing inflammation. This may include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bony prominence.</p>
