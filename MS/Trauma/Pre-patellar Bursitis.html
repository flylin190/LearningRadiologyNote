            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Pre-patellar bursitis typically presents with swelling, pain, and tenderness over the kneecap. The area may also be warm to the touch.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pre-patellar bursitis can occur in anyone, but it is more common in individuals who kneel for extended periods, such as carpet layers, plumbers, and gardeners.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pre-patellar bursitis is caused by irritation or inflammation of the pre-patellar bursa, a small fluid-filled sac located in front of the kneecap.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for pre-patellar bursitis includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE therapy), as well as anti-inflammatory medications. In severe cases, aspiration of the bursa or corticosteroid injections may be necessary.</p>
