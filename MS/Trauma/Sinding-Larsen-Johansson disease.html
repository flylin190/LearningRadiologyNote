            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease presents with knee pain, tenderness, and swelling, especially at the lower edge of the patella (kneecap). The pain is typically aggravated by activities that involve jumping or running.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease is most common in adolescents, particularly those who are active in sports that involve repetitive jumping or running.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease is caused by repetitive stress or tension on the patellar tendon at its insertion point on the lower pole of the patella. This stress can lead to inflammation, pain, and swelling.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Sinding-Larsen-Johansson disease focuses on relieving pain and reducing inflammation. This may include rest, ice, anti-inflammatory medications, and physical therapy. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the bony prominence.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ossification or fragmentation of the inferior pole of the patella on X-ray</li>
                <li>Soft tissue swelling at the inferior pole of the patella</li>
                <li>Apophysitis at the inferior pole of the patella</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Patellar tendonitis</li>
                <li>Patellofemoral pain syndrome</li>
                <li>Patellar stress fracture</li>
