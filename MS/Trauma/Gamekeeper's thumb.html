    <h1>Gamekeeper's Thumb</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Patients with a gamekeeper's thumb typically experience pain, swelling, and instability in the affected thumb. They may have difficulty grasping or pinching due to the injury.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Gamekeeper's thumb, or a tear of the ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) of the thumb, is a relatively common injury, particularly in sports that involve forceful abduction or hyperextension of the thumb.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A gamekeeper's thumb results from a tear or detachment of the UCL from its insertion site at the base of the proximal phalanx of the thumb. This ligament provides stability to the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint of the thumb.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for gamekeeper's thumb depends on the severity of the injury. Minor tears may be treated with immobilization and splinting, while complete tears or avulsions often require surgical repair to restore joint stability.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Joint space widening or subluxation of the MCP joint on stress views</li>
                <li>Avulsion fracture at the insertion site of the UCL on the proximal phalanx</li>
                <li>Soft tissue swelling or edema around the MCP joint</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Thumb sprain</li>
                <li>Fracture of the proximal phalanx or metacarpal</li>
                <li>Collateral ligament injury of other digits</li>
            </ul>
