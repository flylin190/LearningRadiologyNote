        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of a PCL tear include pain, swelling, and instability in the knee. Patients may also experience difficulty walking or bearing weight on the affected knee.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>PCL tears are less common than ACL tears and are often seen in sports-related injuries or trauma to the knee.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A PCL tear is a sprain or tear of the posterior cruciate ligament, which is located in the back of the knee. It can occur due to a direct blow to the front of the knee or from hyperextension of the knee.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for a PCL tear may include rest, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery to reconstruct the torn ligament.</p>
