            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Mucoid change is a histological finding and typically does not cause symptoms on its own.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Mucoid change can occur in various tissues and organs and is often associated with chronic inflammation or degenerative processes.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Mucoid change is characterized by the accumulation of mucin, a jelly-like substance, within tissues. It is often seen in conditions such as osteoarthritis, where it can contribute to joint stiffness and pain.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for mucoid change itself. Treatment is focused on managing the underlying condition, such as arthritis.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Mucoid change may not have specific imaging features, but it can contribute to joint space narrowing and subchondral cyst formation in osteoarthritis.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other forms of joint degeneration, such as fibrous or cystic changes</li>
            </ul>
