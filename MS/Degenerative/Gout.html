    <h1>Gout Arthritis</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Gout arthritis is characterized by sudden and severe pain, swelling, and redness in the joints, often affecting the big toe. It can also cause fever and chills.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Gout is more common in men than women and is often associated with other medical conditions, such as obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Gout is caused by the buildup of uric acid crystals in the joints, leading to inflammation and pain. The buildup of uric acid is often due to the body's inability to process it properly.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for gout aims to reduce pain and inflammation, lower uric acid levels, and prevent future gout attacks. This may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and urate-lowering therapy.</p>
