            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Trochlear dysplasia primarily affects the knee joint, leading to symptoms such as pain, instability, and difficulty with activities requiring knee flexion.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Trochlear dysplasia is a relatively uncommon condition that is often present from birth but may not become symptomatic until later in life.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Trochlear dysplasia is characterized by a shallow or flat trochlear groove, which can result in abnormal tracking of the patella during knee movement.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for trochlear dysplasia may include physical therapy to strengthen the muscles around the knee, bracing or taping to stabilize the patella, and in severe cases, surgery to realign the patella.</p>
