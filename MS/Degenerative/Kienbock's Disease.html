            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of Kienbock's disease include wrist pain, swelling, and limited range of motion. In advanced stages, patients may experience grip weakness and stiffness.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Kienbock's disease is a relatively rare condition, typically affecting young adults between the ages of 20 and 40 years. It is more common in males and in manual workers.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Kienbock's disease is caused by avascular necrosis (death of bone cells due to disrupted blood supply) of the lunate bone in the wrist. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be related to repetitive trauma or anatomical variations in blood supply.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for Kienbock's disease include immobilization, medication to improve blood flow, and surgical interventions such as core decompression, revascularization procedures, or joint-leveling procedures in advanced cases.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sclerosis and fracture lines in the lunate bone on X-ray</li>
                <li>Decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI and increased signal on T2-weighted MRI</li>
                <li>Absence of contrast enhancement in the lunate bone on MRI</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Wrist osteoarthritis</li>
                <li>Lunate bone fracture</li>
