            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition may include acute or chronic joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, typically affecting the knees, wrists, or other joints.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>CPPD deposition is a type of crystalline arthropathy that is more common in older adults, particularly those over the age of 60. It is also associated with certain metabolic disorders, such as hyperparathyroidism and hemochromatosis.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>CPPD deposition is characterized by the formation and deposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals in the cartilage and synovial fluid of joints, leading to inflammation and cartilage damage.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for CPPD deposition include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for acute flares, corticosteroid injections, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in severe cases. Joint replacement surgery may be considered in cases of advanced joint damage.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chondrocalcinosis (calcification of cartilage) on X-ray or CT</li>
                <li>Joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation on X-ray</li>
                <li>Synovial effusion and soft tissue swelling on MRI or ultrasound</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
                <li>Rheumatoid arthritis</li>
                <li>Other crystalline arthropathies (e.g., gout, hydroxyapatite deposition disease)</li>
