            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Charcot joint, also known as neuropathic arthropathy, is characterized by progressive destruction of a joint, leading to deformity, instability, and loss of function.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Charcot joint most commonly affects the feet and ankles, particularly in people with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Charcot joint is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve repetitive trauma to a neuropathic joint, leading to bone and joint destruction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Charcot joint aims to reduce inflammation, stabilize the joint, and prevent further damage. This may include immobilization, orthotic devices, and surgical intervention in severe cases.</p>
