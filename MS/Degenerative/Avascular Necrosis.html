            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of avascular necrosis include joint pain, stiffness, and limited range of motion. The most commonly affected joints are the hip, knee, shoulder, and ankle.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Avascular necrosis can occur at any age, but it is more common in middle-aged adults. Risk factors include corticosteroid use, trauma, alcohol abuse, and certain medical conditions like sickle cell disease.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Avascular necrosis is characterized by the death of bone cells due to disruption of the blood supply to the affected area. This can lead to the collapse of the bone structure and joint damage over time.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for avascular necrosis depend on the stage and severity of the condition. Early stages may be managed with medications or core decompression surgery. In advanced cases, joint replacement surgery may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Subchondral lucency and sclerosis on X-ray</li>
                <li>Bone marrow edema and subchondral fractures on MRI</li>
                <li>Avascular necrosis may progress to joint collapse and deformity</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteoarthritis</li>
                <li>Osteochondritis dissecans</li>
                <li>Bone infarcts (e.g., in sickle cell disease)</li>
