    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Müller-Weiss syndrome is characterized by chronic foot pain, particularly in the midfoot area. Other symptoms may include swelling, stiffness, and difficulty walking.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Müller-Weiss syndrome is a rare condition that typically affects middle-aged women. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be related to abnormal foot anatomy and biomechanics.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Müller-Weiss syndrome is believed to result from a collapse of the navicular bone in the midfoot, leading to progressive degeneration of the surrounding joints and tissues.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Müller-Weiss syndrome aims to relieve pain and improve foot function. This may include orthotic devices, physical therapy, pain medications, and in severe cases, surgery to correct the foot deformity.</p>
