            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is characterized by joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity. It can also cause fatigue, fever, and weight loss.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1% of the population worldwide, with women being more commonly affected than men. It usually begins between the ages of 30 and 60.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease that causes chronic inflammation of the joints, leading to damage and deformity. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for rheumatoid arthritis aims to reduce inflammation, relieve symptoms, and prevent joint damage. This may include medications such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biologic agents.</p>
