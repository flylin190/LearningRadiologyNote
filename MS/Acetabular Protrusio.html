            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Acetabular protrusio is often asymptomatic, but in some cases, it can cause hip pain, limited range of motion, and difficulty walking.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Acetabular protrusio is more common in women and tends to occur in middle-aged and elderly individuals. It can be associated with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and Paget's disease of the bone.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Acetabular protrusio is characterized by the abnormal protrusion of the acetabulum into the pelvic cavity, leading to a decrease in the joint space of the hip.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for acetabular protrusio depends on the underlying cause and severity of symptoms. It may include pain management, physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgery to repair or replace the hip joint.</p>
