            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteomas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to obstruct a sinus or cause pressure on surrounding structures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteomas can occur at any age but are more common in adults. They are benign tumors and are more common in the skull and facial bones.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteomas are benign tumors of the bone that consist of mature compact or cancellous bone. The exact cause of osteomas is unknown, but they are thought to be related to developmental abnormalities of the bone.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most osteomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. Surgical removal may be considered if an osteoma is causing obstruction or significant symptoms.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-circumscribed, dense, and homogenous lesion on X-ray or CT scan</li>
                <li>May have a characteristic "ivory" appearance on CT scan</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteoid osteoma</li>
                <li>Osteoblastoma</li>
                <li>Fibrous dysplasia</li>
