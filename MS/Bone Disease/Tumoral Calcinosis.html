            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Tumoral calcinosis typically presents with painless, slow-growing masses in the soft tissues around the joints, such as the hips, shoulders, and elbows.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition that can occur at any age, but it is most commonly seen in children and young adults. It is more common in certain populations, such as those with African descent.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Tumoral calcinosis is characterized by the formation of large, calcified masses in the soft tissues. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve abnormalities in phosphate metabolism.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for tumoral calcinosis usually involves surgical removal of the calcified masses. In some cases, medications such as phosphate binders may be used to help prevent further calcification.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Large, lobulated soft tissue masses with calcifications on x-ray</li>
                <li>Calcifications may be periarticular or involve the tendons and ligaments</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Calcified synovial sarcoma</li>
                <li>Calcified myositis ossificans</li>
                <li>Calcified abscess</li>
