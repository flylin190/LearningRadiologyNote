            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteopetrosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes bones to become overly dense and prone to fractures. Symptoms may include bone pain, fractures, short stature, and dental abnormalities.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteopetrosis is a rare condition, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 births. It can affect individuals of any age, but it is often diagnosed in childhood.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteopetrosis is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the development and function of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone tissue. These mutations lead to an accumulation of dense, brittle bone tissue.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for osteopetrosis may include medications to manage symptoms, such as pain and fractures, as well as surgery to correct deformities or treat complications.</p>
