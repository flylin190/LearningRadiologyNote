            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of rickets include: 1. Bone pain and tenderness 2. Skeletal deformities (e.g., bowed legs, knock-knees, enlarged wrists and ankles) 3. Delayed growth and motor development  4. Muscle weakness and increased susceptibility to fractures   </p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Rickets is a relatively common condition in developing countries and areas with limited sun exposure or dietary vitamin D intake. It can affect children of any age but is most common between 6 and 24 months.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Rickets is a disorder of impaired mineralization of growing bone and cartilage due to vitamin D deficiency or impaired phosphate metabolism. This leads to the accumulation of unmineralized osteoid and widening of the growth plates.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment involves supplementation with vitamin D and calcium, along with lifestyle modifications to increase sun exposure or dietary intake of vitamin D. In severe cases, phosphate supplementation or medications to correct the underlying metabolic disorder may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Widening and cupping of the metaphyses (characteristic "rachitic rosary")</li>
                <li>Fraying and irregularity of the growth plates</li>
                <li>Osteopenia (reduced bone density)</li>
                <li>Potential skeletal deformities (e.g., bowed legs, knock-knees)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other metabolic bone diseases (e.g., hypophosphatemic rickets, renal osteodystrophy)</li>
                <li>Skeletal dysplasias</li>
                <li>Child abuse (non-accidental trauma)</li>
