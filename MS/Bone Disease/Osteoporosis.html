            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteoporosis is often called a "silent disease" because bone loss occurs without symptoms. People may not know that they have osteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes a fracture.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoporosis is most common in older women. However, men also have this disease. It is estimated that more than 53 million people in the United States either already have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoporosis is a bone disease that occurs when the body loses too much bone, makes too little bone, or both. As a result, bones become weak and may break from a fall or, in serious cases, from sneezing or minor bumps.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for osteoporosis may involve lifestyle changes, such as regular exercise and a healthy diet rich in calcium and vitamin D. Medications may also be prescribed to help prevent bone loss and reduce fracture risk.</p>
