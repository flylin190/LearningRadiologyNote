            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Thyroid aropachy is a condition that affects the thyroid gland, causing symptoms such as bulging eyes (exophthalmos), eye irritation, and double vision. It is often associated with Graves' disease.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Thyroid aropachy is more common in women than men, and usually occurs in people with Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes overactivity of the thyroid gland.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of thyroid aropachy is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve an autoimmune response that targets the tissues around the eyes and the thyroid gland.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for thyroid aropachy focuses on managing symptoms and may include medications to reduce inflammation and swelling, as well as surgery in severe cases to correct eye bulging.</p>
