            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a syndrome characterized by clubbing of the fingers and toes, periostitis (inflammation of the periosteum), and arthritis. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as lung cancer, heart disease, and liver disease.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is a rare condition that can affect individuals of any age. It is more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is not fully understood, but it is believed to involve abnormal growth factors or cytokines that stimulate bone and tissue growth.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for hypertrophic osteoarthropathy focuses on addressing the underlying cause. This may include treating the underlying condition (such as lung cancer or heart disease) and managing symptoms with pain medications and other supportive measures.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Soft tissue swelling around the joints</li>
                <li>Long bone metaphyseal and diaphyseal smooth periosteal reaction on x-ray</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (pachydermoperiostosis)</li>
                <li>Secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (associated with underlying conditions)</li>
