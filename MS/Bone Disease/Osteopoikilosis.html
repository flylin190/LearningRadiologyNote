            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteopoikilosis is typically asymptomatic and is often discovered incidentally on radiographic studies performed for other reasons.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteopoikilosis is a rare, benign skeletal dysplasia that can occur sporadically or as an inherited autosomal dominant condition. It is present from birth and affects both males and females equally.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteopoikilosis is characterized by the presence of multiple, randomly distributed, compact bone lesions or islands throughout the skeleton. These lesions are thought to result from a defect in endochondral bone formation during embryonic development.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Osteopoikilosis is a benign condition that does not require specific treatment. Management involves reassurance and education about the benign nature of the condition.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple, round or oval, dense bone lesions scattered throughout the skeleton</li>
                <li>Lesions are typically small (1-10 mm) and have a uniform appearance</li>
                <li>Lesions are most commonly found in the epiphyses and metaphyses of long bones, but can also be present in the axial skeleton</li>
                <li>No associated soft tissue or bony reaction</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bone islands (enostoses)</li>
                <li>Osteoblastic metastases</li>
                <li>Mastocytosis with bone involvement</li>
                <li>Osteosarcoma (in cases with atypical or aggressive appearance)</li>
            </ul>
