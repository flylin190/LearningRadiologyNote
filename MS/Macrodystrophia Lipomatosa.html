            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is a rare congenital disorder characterized by overgrowth of the bone and surrounding soft tissues, typically affecting the fingers and toes.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Macrodystrophia lipomatosa is a rare condition, with less than 100 cases reported in the literature. It is usually present at birth or becomes apparent during childhood.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of macrodystrophia lipomatosa is unknown, but it is thought to result from a disturbance in the growth of the nerves that supply the affected area, leading to overgrowth of the bone and soft tissues.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for macrodystrophia lipomatosa depends on the severity of the condition and the extent of the overgrowth. It may include surgery to remove excess tissue and improve function and appearance.</p>
