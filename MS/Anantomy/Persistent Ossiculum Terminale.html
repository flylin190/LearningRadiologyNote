            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most cases of persistent ossiculum terminale are asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, some patients may experience neck pain or stiffness.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Persistent ossiculum terminale is a rare condition that is present from birth. It is more common in females than males.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Persistent ossiculum terminale is a congenital abnormality where a small, separate ossicle is present at the tip of the odontoid process of the axis vertebra. It represents the ossification center of the tip of the odontoid process that normally fuses with the body of the axis by the age of 12 years.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most cases of persistent ossiculum terminale do not require treatment. However, in cases where there is significant neck pain or instability, surgical removal of the ossicle may be considered.</p>
