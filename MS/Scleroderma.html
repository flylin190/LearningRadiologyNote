            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin and connective tissues to become hard and tight. Symptoms may include thickening of the skin, Raynaud's phenomenon, digestive problems, joint pain, and shortness of breath.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Scleroderma is relatively rare and affects women more often than men. It usually occurs between the ages of 30 and 50, but can also affect children and the elderly.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Scleroderma is characterized by excessive collagen production, leading to fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve an autoimmune response.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for scleroderma aims to manage symptoms and slow disease progression. This may include medications to improve blood flow, reduce inflammation, and suppress the immune system.</p>
