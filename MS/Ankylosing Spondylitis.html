            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Ankylosing spondylitis typically presents with chronic back pain and stiffness, especially in the morning or after periods of inactivity. Other symptoms may include pain and swelling in other joints, fatigue, and loss of appetite.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Ankylosing spondylitis is more common in men than women, and usually begins in early adulthood. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by inflammation of the joints in the spine, leading to pain, stiffness, and eventually fusion of the vertebrae. This can result in a stooped posture and reduced flexibility of the spine.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for ankylosing spondylitis aims to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. This may include physical therapy, medications to reduce inflammation and pain, and in severe cases, surgery to correct spinal deformities.</p>
