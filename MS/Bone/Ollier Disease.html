            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Ollier disease is characterized by multiple enchondromas, which are benign cartilaginous tumors, in the bones. It can lead to bone deformities, limb length discrepancies, and fractures.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Ollier disease is a rare condition that usually presents in childhood. The exact cause is unknown, but it is not inherited in a simple Mendelian manner.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Enchondromas in Ollier disease are typically located in the metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones and are composed of hyaline cartilage.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Ollier disease is typically focused on managing symptoms and complications, such as fractures. Surgery may be required to correct bone deformities.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple well-defined lucent lesions with thin sclerotic rims on plain radiographs</li>
                <li>Enchondromas typically involve the metaphysis and diaphysis of long bones</li>
                <li>May lead to bowing of affected bones</li>
            </ul>
