            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Enchondromas are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally on imaging studies performed for other reasons. However, they can cause pain, swelling, or fractures if they occur in weight-bearing bones or undergo malignant transformation.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Enchondromas are the most common primary bone tumor of the hand, typically affecting individuals between the ages of 10 and 40 years.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Enchondromas are benign cartilaginous tumors that arise from the medullary cavity of the bone. They are composed of hyaline cartilage and can undergo malignant transformation to chondrosarcoma in rare cases.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Asymptomatic enchondromas usually do not require treatment. However, symptomatic or aggressive lesions may require surgical resection.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined lytic lesion with stippled or ring-and-arc calcifications on x-ray</li>
                <li>Homogeneous low signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI</li>
                <li>Enhancement may be seen with contrast administration</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chondrosarcoma</li>
                <li>Fibrous dysplasia</li>
                <li>Osteochondroma</li>
