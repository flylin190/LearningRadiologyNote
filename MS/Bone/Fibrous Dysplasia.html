            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Fibrous dysplasia may be asymptomatic or present with pain, swelling, or deformity of the affected bone. It can also lead to fractures or other complications.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Fibrous dysplasia can occur at any age but is most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults. It can affect any bone in the body.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Fibrous dysplasia is characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and immature woven bone. It is caused by a genetic mutation in the GNAS gene.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment for fibrous dysplasia depends on the symptoms and extent of the disease. It may include monitoring, pain management, and surgical intervention in some cases.</p>
