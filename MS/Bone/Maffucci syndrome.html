    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Maffucci syndrome is characterized by multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas. Patients may present with pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected bones.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Maffucci syndrome is a rare disorder that typically presents in childhood. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to be a sporadic genetic mutation.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Maffucci syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas, which are benign cartilaginous tumors, and hemangiomas, which are benign vascular tumors.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for Maffucci syndrome. Management is focused on addressing symptoms and complications, such as pain and fractures, associated with the tumors.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple enchondromas and hemangiomas on x-ray</li>
                <li>Enchondromas typically have a stippled or ring-and-arc calcification pattern</li>
                <li>Hemangiomas may appear as areas of increased vascularity</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ollier disease (multiple enchondromatosis)</li>
                <li>Hereditary multiple exostoses</li>
                <li>Metastatic disease</li>
