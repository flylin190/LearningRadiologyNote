        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Morel-Lavallée lesions typically present as a fluctuant, tender, soft tissue mass. They are commonly found over the greater trochanter, thigh, or knee, and may be associated with overlying skin changes such as ecchymosis or erythema.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Morel-Lavallée lesions are often the result of trauma, such as a blunt impact or shearing force, and are more common in active individuals, such as athletes.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A Morel-Lavallée lesion is a closed degloving soft tissue injury that results from shearing forces that disrupt the blood supply between the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying fascia.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Morel-Lavallée lesions may include drainage of the fluid collection, compression therapy, and in some cases, surgical intervention to remove the lesion.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fluid collection between subcutaneous tissue and fascia on ultrasound or MRI</li>
                <li>Hyperintense signal on T1-weighted MRI</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Hematoma</li>
                <li>Seroma</li>
                <li>Soft tissue abscess</li>
