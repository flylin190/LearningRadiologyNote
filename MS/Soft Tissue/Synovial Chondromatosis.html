            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Synovial chondromatosis typically presents with joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. It most commonly affects the large joints, such as the knee, hip, and shoulder.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Synovial chondromatosis is a rare benign condition that usually affects adults between the ages of 30 and 60. It is more common in men than women.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Synovial chondromatosis is characterized by the formation of multiple cartilaginous nodules within the synovial membrane of joints. These nodules can detach and become free-floating within the joint space, leading to pain and joint dysfunction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for synovial chondromatosis usually involves surgical removal of the loose bodies (nodules) from the joint. In some cases, arthroscopic surgery may be used to remove the nodules and clean out the joint.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple calcified nodules within the joint on X-ray</li>
                <li>Low to intermediate signal intensity on T1-weighted MRI</li>
                <li>High signal intensity on T2-weighted MRI</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteochondritis dissecans</li>
