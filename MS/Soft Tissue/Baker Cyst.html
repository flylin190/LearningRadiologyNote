            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>A Baker cyst may be asymptomatic or cause symptoms such as swelling and stiffness behind the knee, pain, and discomfort when bending the knee.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Baker cysts are relatively common, occurring in about 5% of the general population. They are more common in individuals with underlying conditions like osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or knee injuries.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A Baker cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that forms behind the knee joint, due to protrusion or herniation of the synovial membrane through the posterior capsule of the knee.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for Baker cysts include conservative management with physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and aspiration or injection of the cyst with steroids. In some cases, surgical removal of the cyst may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fluid-filled, well-defined mass in the popliteal fossa (behind the knee) on ultrasound or MRI</li>
                <li>May communicate with the knee joint on MRI</li>
                <li>Associated joint effusion or synovitis may be present</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Popliteal artery aneurysm</li>
                <li>Popliteal cyst (non-communicating with joint)</li>
                <li>Soft tissue mass or tumor</li>
