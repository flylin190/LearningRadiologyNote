            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of bursitis include pain, swelling, and tenderness around the affected joint. The pain may worsen with movement or pressure on the joint.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Bursitis can affect anyone, but it is more common in adults, especially those who perform repetitive motions or put pressure on specific joints.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Bursitis is inflammation of the bursa, which are small sacs filled with fluid that cushion and lubricate joints. The exact cause of bursitis is often unknown, but it can be related to injury, overuse, or underlying conditions such as arthritis.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for bursitis usually involves rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE), along with anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, corticosteroid injections or physical therapy may be recommended.</p>
