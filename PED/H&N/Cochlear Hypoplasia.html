            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The primary symptom of cochlear hypoplasia is sensorineural hearing loss, which can range from mild to profound, depending on the severity of the malformation.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cochlear hypoplasia is a relatively rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 100,000 births. It can occur as an isolated finding or in association with other congenital anomalies or syndromes.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Cochlear hypoplasia is a congenital malformation characterized by an underdeveloped or incompletely formed cochlea, which is the spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear responsible for hearing. The underlying cause can be genetic or environmental factors affecting embryonic development.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for cochlear hypoplasia depends on the severity of the hearing loss and may involve the use of hearing aids or cochlear implants. Early intervention with speech and language therapy is also crucial to support communication and language development.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Incomplete or absent cochlear turns</li>
                <li>Abnormal cochlear size or shape</li>
                <li>Associated abnormalities of the internal auditory canal or vestibular system</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other congenital inner ear malformations (e.g., Michel deformity, Mondini dysplasia)</li>
                <li>Acquired hearing loss</li>
                <li>Conductive hearing loss</li>
