            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Lhermitte-Duclos disease, also known as dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma, is a rare benign tumor of the cerebellum. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar dysfunction, including ataxia, headache, and signs of increased intracranial pressure such as nausea, vomiting, and papilledema.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Lhermitte-Duclos disease is a rare condition, with only a few hundred cases reported in the medical literature. It can occur at any age, but it most commonly affects adults in their 30s and 40s.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Lhermitte-Duclos disease is characterized by the presence of a hamartomatous lesion in the cerebellum, composed of abnormally large and disorganized ganglion cells. These cells are typically arranged in a "parallel fiber" pattern, giving the lesion a characteristic striated appearance on imaging studies.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment of Lhermitte-Duclos disease typically involves surgical resection of the lesion. This can help relieve symptoms and prevent complications associated with increased intracranial pressure.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Striated appearance on MRI due to the "parallel fiber" pattern</li>
                <li>Mass effect on adjacent structures in the posterior fossa</li>
                <li>Typically hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images</li>
            </ul>
