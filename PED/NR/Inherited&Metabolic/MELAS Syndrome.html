    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>MELAS syndrome is characterized by a combination of stroke-like episodes, seizures, and muscle weakness. Other symptoms may include headaches, vomiting, and vision and hearing loss.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>MELAS syndrome is a rare condition that typically begins in childhood or early adulthood. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>MELAS syndrome is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which leads to impaired energy production in cells, particularly in the brain, muscles, and nerves.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for MELAS syndrome is mainly supportive and aims to manage symptoms. This may include medications to control seizures and prevent stroke-like episodes, as well as physical therapy to improve muscle function.</p>
