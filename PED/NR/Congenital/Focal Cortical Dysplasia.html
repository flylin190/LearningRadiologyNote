    <h1>Focal Cortical Dysplasia</h1>

            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is often associated with drug-resistant epilepsy, with seizures being the most common symptom. The severity of symptoms can vary depending on the location and extent of the lesion.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>FCD is a relatively common cause of intractable epilepsy, particularly in children and young adults. The exact prevalence is unknown but is estimated to be around 20-40% of patients with intractable epilepsy.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>FCD is a localized malformation of cortical development, characterized by abnormal neuronal proliferation, migration, and organization within a localized area of the cerebral cortex. It can be classified into three main subtypes based on histopathological features.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for FCD typically involves antiepileptic medications to control seizures. In cases of drug-resistant epilepsy, surgical resection of the affected cortical region may be considered if it is safely accessible.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Localized cortical thickening or dysplastic cortical region</li>
                <li>Abnormal gyral pattern or cortical dyslamination</li>
                <li>Increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FLAIR sequences</li>
                <li>Abnormal cortical-white matter junction or "transmantle" sign</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Low-grade gliomas</li>
                <li>Tuberous sclerosis complex</li>
                <li>Ischemic or traumatic cortical scarring</li>
                <li>Other cortical malformations (e.g., heterotopia, polymicrogyria)</li>
            </ul>
