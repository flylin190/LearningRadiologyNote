            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Cephaloceles may be asymptomatic or present with symptoms depending on their size and location. Potential symptoms include a visible or palpable mass, headaches, seizures, and neurological deficits related to the herniated brain tissue or associated malformations.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Cephaloceles are rare congenital malformations, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 5,000 births. They can occur in various locations, with occipital cephaloceles being the most common type.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A cephalocele is a herniation or protrusion of intracranial contents (brain tissue, meninges, or both) through a defect in the skull. It is caused by a failure of the neural tube to close properly during embryonic development.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for cephaloceles typically involves surgical repair to correct the defect and reposition the herniated contents back into the cranial cavity. The timing and approach depend on the size, location, and associated malformations. Some small cephaloceles may be monitored without intervention.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Bony defect in the skull with a herniated sac or mass</li>
                <li>Herniated intracranial contents (brain tissue, meninges, or both) within the sac</li>
                <li>Associated brain malformations or ventriculomegaly</li>
