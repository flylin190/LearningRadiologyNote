    <h1>Sinus Pericranii</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Many patients with sinus pericranii are asymptomatic, and the condition is often discovered incidentally. However, some patients may experience a palpable mass or swelling over the affected area, which may increase in size with Valsalva maneuvers or compression of the jugular veins.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Sinus pericranii is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of less than 0.5% in the general population. It can occur at any age but is more commonly seen in infants and children.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Sinus pericranii is a vascular malformation characterized by an abnormal communication between the intracranial dural venous sinuses and the extracranial venous system. It is typically located in the posterior fossa or along the superior sagittal sinus.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most cases of sinus pericranii are asymptomatic and do not require treatment. For symptomatic or complicated cases, treatment options may include surgical resection or endovascular embolization, depending on the location and extent of the malformation.</p>
