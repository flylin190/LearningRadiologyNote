            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of porencephaly can include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, motor deficits, and visual disturbances, depending on the location and extent of the brain abnormality.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Porencephaly is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of around 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 20,000 births.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Porencephaly is a rare disorder characterized by a cyst or cavity in the brain parenchyma, communicating with the ventricular system or subarachnoid space. It is thought to result from cerebral ischemia or hemorrhage during fetal development, leading to tissue destruction and cyst formation.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for porencephaly itself. Management focuses on addressing the associated symptoms, such as controlling seizures with anti-epileptic medications, and providing physical, occupational, and speech therapy to support development and function.</p>
