            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Megalencephaly is characterized by an abnormally large head circumference and an enlarged brain. Symptoms may include developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and neurological deficits, depending on the underlying cause.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Megalencephaly is a rare condition, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 20,000 to 1 in 30,000 births. It can occur as an isolated finding or in association with various genetic conditions or metabolic disorders.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Megalencephaly can be caused by various underlying conditions, including genetic disorders (e.g., PI3K-related overgrowth disorders, mutations in the PTEN gene), metabolic disorders (e.g., glutaric aciduria type 1), or developmental abnormalities affecting brain growth and development.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for megalencephaly is largely supportive and depends on the underlying cause and associated symptoms. Management may involve anti-seizure medications, physical and occupational therapy, and educational interventions.</p>
