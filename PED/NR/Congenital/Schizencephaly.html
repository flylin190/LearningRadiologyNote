    <section class="content">

            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of schizencephaly can vary widely depending on the extent and location of the brain malformation. Common symptoms include developmental delays, intellectual disability, seizures, and motor deficits such as spasticity or weakness.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Schizencephaly is a rare congenital brain malformation, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 1 in 64,000 births. It is more common in premature infants and those with other associated malformations.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Schizencephaly is characterized by abnormal clefts or cleavages in the cerebral hemispheres, ranging from mild slits to severe clefts extending from the cortical surface to the lateral ventricles. It is believed to result from abnormal neuronal migration and organization during early fetal brain development.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for schizencephaly itself. Management focuses on addressing the associated symptoms and complications, such as seizure control with anticonvulsant medications, physical and occupational therapy, and management of other neurological deficits.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Clefts or cleavages in the cerebral hemispheres</li>
                <li>Abnormal gyral pattern and gray matter lining the clefts</li>
                <li>Polymicrogyria (abnormal small gyri) adjacent to the clefts</li>
                <li>Possible associated brain malformations (e.g., corpus callosum agenesis, heterotopia)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Porencephalic cyst</li>
                <li>Severe polymicrogyria</li>
                <li>Ischemic or traumatic brain injury</li>
                <li>Other congenital brain malformations</li>
