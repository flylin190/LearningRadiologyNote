            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of polymicrogyria can vary greatly depending on the extent and location of the abnormality, but may include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and motor deficits.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>The exact prevalence of polymicrogyria is unknown, but it is considered a relatively rare condition.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Polymicrogyria is characterized by an excessive number of small gyri (convolutions) on the surface of the brain. It is thought to result from abnormal neuronal migration and cortical organization during fetal brain development.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for polymicrogyria itself. Management typically focuses on addressing the associated symptoms, such as controlling seizures with anti-epileptic medications, and providing physical, occupational, and speech therapy to support development and function.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Excessive number of small, abnormally formed gyri on the brain surface</li>
                <li>Cortical thickening and irregularity</li>
                <li>May be focal or diffuse</li>
