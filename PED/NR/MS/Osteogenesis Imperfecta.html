    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta is characterized by fragile bones that break easily, often with minimal or no apparent trauma. Other symptoms may include short stature, blue sclerae, hearing loss, and dental problems.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta is a genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 10,000 to 20,000 individuals worldwide. It can occur in people of all ethnicities and both sexes.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteogenesis imperfecta is caused by mutations in the COL1A1 or COL1A2 genes, which are involved in the production of type I collagen, the main protein in bone.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for osteogenesis imperfecta focuses on managing symptoms and preventing fractures. This may include physical therapy, bracing, surgery to correct bone deformities, and medications to improve bone density.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fragile, thin bones with multiple fractures on x-ray</li>
                <li>Bowing of long bones</li>
                <li>Wormian bones (extra bones in the skull)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Child abuse (non-accidental injury)</li>
                <li>Other genetic bone disorders, such as osteopetrosis</li>
