            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Osteosarcoma often presents with bone pain, swelling, or a mass in the affected area. It may also cause fractures or bone weakening.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteosarcoma is the most common type of bone cancer, primarily affecting children and young adults. It most commonly occurs in the long bones of the arms and legs.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteosarcoma is characterized by the production of osteoid (immature bone tissue) by the tumor cells. It is classified into several subtypes based on the appearance of the tumor cells and the type of bone affected.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for osteosarcoma typically involves a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and occasionally radiation therapy. Targeted therapies and immunotherapy may also be used in some cases.</p>
