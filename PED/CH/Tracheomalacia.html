            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Common symptoms of tracheomalacia include recurrent respiratory infections, wheezing, cough, and respiratory distress, especially during exhalation.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Tracheomalacia can occur at any age, but it is more common in infants and children. It can be congenital or acquired due to various underlying conditions.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Tracheomalacia is characterized by weakness or floppiness of the tracheal cartilage, leading to collapse and narrowing of the airway during exhalation or coughing.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for tracheomalacia depends on the severity and underlying cause. Mild cases may be managed conservatively with monitoring and treatment of associated conditions. Severe cases may require surgical intervention, such as tracheal stenting or aortopexy, to maintain airway patency.</p>
