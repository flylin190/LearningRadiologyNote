            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Kohler disease symptoms include gait abnormalities, tarsal pain, and foot swelling.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Kohler disease typically affects children, especially boys. It usually only affects one foot.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Kohler disease is avascular necrosis of the navicular bone, possibly due to insufficient blood supply.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Kohler disease usually does not require treatment as it resolves on its own as the child grows. In some cases, supportive shoe inserts or shoes may be needed.</p>
