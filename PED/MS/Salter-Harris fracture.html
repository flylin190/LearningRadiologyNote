        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The symptoms of a Salter-Harris fracture vary depending on the severity and location of the fracture. Common symptoms include pain, swelling, bruising, and difficulty using the affected limb.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Salter-Harris fractures are most common in children and adolescents, especially those involved in sports or activities that put stress on the bones.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>A Salter-Harris fracture is a type of fracture that involves the growth plate (physis) of a bone. It is classified into five types (I-V) based on the extent of the fracture through the growth plate and the surrounding bone.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The treatment for a Salter-Harris fracture depends on the type and severity of the fracture but may include immobilization with a cast or splint, closed reduction (manipulation of the fracture without surgery), or open reduction (surgery to realign the fracture).</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fracture line extending through the growth plate on X-ray</li>
                <li>Varies depending on the Salter-Harris type</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other types of bone fractures (e.g., transverse, oblique, comminuted)</li>
                <li>Growth plate injuries without fracture</li>
                <li>Soft tissue injuries (e.g., sprains, strains)</li>
