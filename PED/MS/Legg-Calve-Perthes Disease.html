            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease typically presents with hip pain, limping, and limited range of motion in the affected hip. It usually affects children between the ages of 4 and 10.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is more common in boys than girls, and it often affects children who are small for their age or have a family history of the disease.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Legg-Calve-Perthes disease is caused by a disruption of blood flow to the femoral head, leading to avascular necrosis (death of bone tissue) and eventual collapse of the femoral head.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Legg-Calve-Perthes disease aims to preserve the shape of the femoral head and prevent deformity. This may include rest, physical therapy, bracing, and in severe cases, surgery to reshape the femoral head.</p>
