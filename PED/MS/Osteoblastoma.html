            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>The main symptom of osteoblastoma is localized pain, which may be severe and worse at night. Other symptoms may include swelling, tenderness, and restricted range of motion in the affected area.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoblastoma is a rare benign bone tumor that typically affects adolescents and young adults, with a peak incidence between 10 and 25 years of age. It accounts for approximately 1% of all primary bone tumors.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Osteoblastoma is a benign neoplasm composed of osteoblasts, which are cells responsible for bone formation. It is characterized by the presence of osteoid and immature bone formation within the tumor.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The primary treatment for osteoblastoma is surgical resection, which can be curative in most cases. The extent of resection depends on the location and size of the tumor, with the goal of preserving the surrounding healthy bone and joint function as much as possible.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, lytic, and expansile bone lesion</li>
                <li>Sclerotic rim surrounding the lesion</li>
                <li>Matrix mineralization or calcification within the lesion</li>
                <li>Periosteal reaction or bone formation may be present</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Osteoid osteoma</li>
                <li>Osteosarcoma</li>
                <li>Aneurysmal bone cyst</li>
                <li>Fibrous dysplasia</li>
