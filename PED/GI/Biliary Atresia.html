            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Biliary atresia typically presents in infants with jaundice that persists beyond the first two weeks of life, dark urine, pale stools, and hepatomegaly.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Biliary atresia is a rare disease that affects infants, with the majority of cases occurring in the first few months of life. The exact cause is unknown, but it is thought to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Biliary atresia is characterized by the progressive destruction or absence of the bile ducts inside and outside the liver, leading to bile flow obstruction and subsequent liver damage.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for biliary atresia is surgery to restore bile flow. The Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy) is performed to create a new pathway for bile drainage.</p>
