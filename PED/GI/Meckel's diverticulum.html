            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Meckel's diverticulum may be asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, rectal bleeding, and intestinal obstruction.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital anomaly that occurs in about 2% of the population. It is more common in males than females.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Meckel's diverticulum is a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct, which normally disappears during embryonic development. It is located on the antimesenteric border of the ileum, usually within 2 feet of the ileocecal valve.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for symptomatic Meckel's diverticulum usually involves surgical removal (diverticulectomy).</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Meckel's diverticulum may be visualized on imaging studies such as CT scan or ultrasound.</li>
