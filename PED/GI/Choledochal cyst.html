            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Choledochal cysts may present with abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. In some cases, they may be asymptomatic and discovered incidentally on imaging.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Choledochal cysts are more common in females and are often diagnosed in infancy or early childhood.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Choledochal cysts are congenital bile duct abnormalities that result in cystic dilatation of the biliary tree. The exact cause is unknown, but genetic and environmental factors may play a role.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>The main treatment for choledochal cysts is surgical removal of the cyst and reconstruction of the biliary tract.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cystic dilatation of the common bile duct on ultrasound or CT scan</li>
                <li>Communication between the cyst and the bile duct on MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Biliary atresia</li>
                <li>Choledocholithiasis</li>
