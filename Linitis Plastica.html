            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Linitis plastica, also known as "leather bottle stomach," presents with early satiety, weight loss, and abdominal pain. It is often associated with gastric adenocarcinoma.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Linitis plastica is rare and most commonly affects older adults. It is more common in men than women.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Linitis plastica is characterized by thickening and rigidity of the stomach wall due to diffuse infiltration of cancer cells, leading to a shrunken, leather-like appearance of the stomach.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for linitis plastica usually involves surgery to remove the affected part of the stomach, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.</p>
