    <h1>Tuberous Sclerosis</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of tuberous sclerosis can vary widely and may include seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, skin abnormalities (e.g., facial angiofibromas, hypomelanotic macules), and benign tumors in various organs (e.g., brain, kidneys, lungs, heart).</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Tuberous sclerosis is a rare genetic disorder, affecting approximately 1 in 6,000 to 1 in 10,000 individuals worldwide. It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 genes, which regulate cell growth and proliferation. These mutations lead to the development of hamartomatous lesions (e.g., cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, angiomyolipomas) in various organs, including the brain, kidneys, lungs, and skin.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for tuberous sclerosis is multidisciplinary and aimed at managing specific symptoms and complications. Antiepileptic medications are used for seizure control, and various therapies (e.g., physical, occupational, and speech therapy) may be recommended for developmental delays. Regular monitoring and treatment of associated tumors or organ involvement may also be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Cortical tubers (see previous page)</li>
                <li>Subependymal nodules (may calcify and produce obstructive hydrocephalus)</li>
                <li>Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs)</li>
                <li>Renal angiomyolipomas</li>
                <li>Cardiac rhabdomyomas</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other neurocutaneous disorders (e.g., neurofibromatosis, Sturge-Weber syndrome)</li>
                <li>Cortical malformations (e.g., focal cortical dysplasia, heterotopia)</li>
                <li>Low-grade gliomas</li>
