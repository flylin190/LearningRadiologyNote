            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Diastematomyelia may present with back pain, lower extremity weakness, and bladder or bowel dysfunction. Symptoms can vary depending on the severity of the condition.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Diastematomyelia is a rare congenital disorder that is more common in females than males. It is often associated with other spinal cord abnormalities.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Diastematomyelia is characterized by the presence of a longitudinal cleft or clefts in the spinal cord, which can cause tethering of the spinal cord and neurological symptoms.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for diastematomyelia depends on the severity of symptoms and may include surgery to release tethered spinal cord, relieve pressure on the spinal cord, and stabilize the spine.</p>
