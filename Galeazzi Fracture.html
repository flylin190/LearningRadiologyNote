            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Galeazzi fracture is a fracture of the radius bone in the forearm, usually accompanied by dislocation of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ). Symptoms include pain, swelling, and deformity of the forearm.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Galeazzi fracture is more common in younger individuals and often results from a fall onto an outstretched hand.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The fracture occurs at the junction of the middle and distal thirds of the radius bone, often with associated disruption of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC).</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment of Galeazzi fracture involves surgical fixation of the radius and stabilization of the DRUJ. Immobilization with a cast may also be necessary.</p>
