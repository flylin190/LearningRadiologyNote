            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Mounier-Kuhn syndrome, also known as tracheobronchomegaly, is a rare condition characterized by abnormal dilation of the trachea and main bronchi. It can lead to chronic respiratory symptoms such as cough, sputum production, and recurrent respiratory infections.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is a rare disease that typically presents in adulthood. It is more common in men than women.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The exact cause of Mounier-Kuhn syndrome is unknown. It is thought to be related to a weakness in the tracheal and bronchial walls, leading to their dilation.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for Mounier-Kuhn syndrome aims to manage symptoms and prevent complications. This may include bronchodilators, mucolytic agents, antibiotics for infections, and in severe cases, surgery to repair or support the weakened airways.</p>
