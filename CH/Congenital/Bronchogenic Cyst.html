    <h1>Bronchogenic Cyst</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Many bronchogenic cysts are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally. However, larger cysts may cause symptoms such as cough, chest pain, wheezing, or dyspnea due to compression of adjacent structures.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Bronchogenic cysts are congenital lesions, present from birth, but may not be detected until later in life. They account for approximately 10-20% of mediastinal masses in adults.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Bronchogenic cysts are developmental anomalies that arise from an abnormal budding of the ventral foregut during embryonic development. They are lined with respiratory epithelium and may contain cartilage or bronchial glands.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for bronchogenic cysts typically involves surgical resection, especially for symptomatic or enlarging cysts. Asymptomatic and small cysts may be monitored with periodic imaging.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, smooth-walled cystic mass on CT or MRI</li>
                <li>Characteristic location in the mediastinum, often near the trachea or main bronchi</li>
                <li>May contain air or fluid, with or without internal septations</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Other mediastinal cysts (e.g., pericardial, thymic, esophageal)</li>
                <li>Mediastinal lymph node enlargement</li>
                <li>Mediastinal masses or tumors</li>
            </ul>
