            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Most patients with pulmonary sequestration are asymptomatic, but some may present with recurrent respiratory infections, cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary sequestration is a rare congenital malformation that can occur at any age, but it is most commonly diagnosed in infants and children.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary sequestration involves a non-functioning lung tissue that does not communicate with the normal airway and receives its blood supply from the systemic circulation instead of the pulmonary circulation.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for pulmonary sequestration depends on the patient's symptoms and the size and location of the lesion. Options include observation, surgical resection, or embolization of the feeding artery.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Chest CT may show a non-communicating lung mass with systemic arterial supply</li>
                <li>Angiography can demonstrate the abnormal blood supply to the sequestrated lung tissue</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pulmonary arteriovenous malformation (AVM)</li>
                <li>Pulmonary neoplasm (e.g., bronchogenic carcinoma)</li>
            </ul>
