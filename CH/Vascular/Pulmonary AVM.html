    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary AVM may present with symptoms such as dyspnea (shortness of breath), cyanosis (bluish discoloration of the skin), clubbing of fingers, and migraine headaches (due to paradoxical emboli).</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary AVMs are rare and can occur sporadically or as part of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), also known as Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary AVM is an abnormal connection between pulmonary arteries and veins, bypassing the capillary bed, which can lead to right-to-left shunting of blood.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for pulmonary AVM may include embolization of the abnormal vessels to prevent shunting and reduce the risk of complications such as stroke or brain abscess.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast-enhanced CT or MRI can show the abnormal connection between pulmonary arteries and veins</li>
                <li>Pulmonary angiography is the gold standard for diagnosis</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Aorto-pulmonary fistula</li>
                <li>Pulmonary embolism</li>
                <li>Pulmonary vasculitis</li>
