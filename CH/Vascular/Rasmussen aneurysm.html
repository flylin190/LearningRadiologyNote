            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Rasmussen aneurysm is often asymptomatic but may present with symptoms related to compression of adjacent structures, such as cough, hemoptysis, or chest pain. In rare cases, rupture of the aneurysm can lead to massive hemoptysis.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Rasmussen aneurysm is a rare complication of pulmonary tuberculosis, typically occurring in patients with active or past tuberculosis infection.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Rasmussen aneurysm is characterized by a pseudoaneurysm formation in a pulmonary artery branch adjacent to a tuberculous cavity. It results from erosion of the artery wall by the adjacent cavity.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment of Rasmussen aneurysm depends on the clinical presentation and size of the aneurysm. Options include medical management with antituberculous therapy, embolization of the aneurysm, or surgical resection.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Pseudoaneurysm formation adjacent to a tuberculous cavity on chest imaging</li>
                <li>Contrast-enhanced CT or angiography can demonstrate the aneurysm and its relationship to adjacent structures</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>True pulmonary artery aneurysm</li>
                <li>Pulmonary artery pseudoaneurysm from other causes</li>
