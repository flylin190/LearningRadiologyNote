            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Symptoms of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease include shortness of breath, fatigue, cough, and eventually, right-sided heart failure.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare condition, with an estimated incidence of less than 1 per million population. It can occur at any age but is more common in children and young adults.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is characterized by progressive obstruction and remodeling of the small pulmonary veins, leading to increased pulmonary vascular resistance and eventual right-sided heart failure.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment options for pulmonary veno-occlusive disease are limited. Supportive measures, such as oxygen therapy and diuretics, may provide symptomatic relief. Lung transplantation is the only potentially curative option for eligible patients.</p>
