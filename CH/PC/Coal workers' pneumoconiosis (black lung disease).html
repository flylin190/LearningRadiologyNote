            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Coal workers' pneumoconiosis can be asymptomatic in its early stages. As the disease progresses, symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. In severe cases, it can lead to progressive massive fibrosis and respiratory failure.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Coal workers' pneumoconiosis is caused by long-term exposure to coal dust. It is more common in coal miners and those who work in coal-related industries.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>The inhalation of coal dust leads to the deposition of carbon particles in the lungs, which triggers an inflammatory response. Over time, this can lead to the formation of fibrotic nodules and scarring in the lungs.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for coal workers' pneumoconiosis. Management involves avoiding further exposure to coal dust and treating symptoms, such as with bronchodilators and oxygen therapy.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Small nodular opacities on chest X-ray or CT scan</li>
                <li>Progressive massive fibrosis characterized by large, dense opacities</li>
