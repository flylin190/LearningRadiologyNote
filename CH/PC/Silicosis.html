    <h1>Silicosis</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Silicosis is a lung disease caused by breathing in tiny bits of silica, a mineral that is part of sand, rock, and mineral ores. This can lead to inflammation and scarring in the lungs, which can cause symptoms such as cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Silicosis most often affects workers exposed to silica dust in occupations such as mining, construction, and sandblasting.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Inhaled silica particles are phagocytized by macrophages, leading to the release of inflammatory mediators and the formation of fibrous nodules and scars in the lungs.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>There is no specific treatment for silicosis. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing complications. In severe cases, lung transplantation may be considered.</p>
