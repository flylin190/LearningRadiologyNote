            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Lymphangioleimyomatosis (LAM) commonly presents with dyspnea, cough, and chest pain. It can also lead to pneumothorax and chylous effusions.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>LAM primarily affects women of childbearing age. It is often associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), but sporadic cases also occur.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>LAM is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells) in the lungs, lymphatics, and kidneys. These cells form cystic lesions and cause tissue destruction.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for LAM focuses on symptom management and may include bronchodilators, oxygen therapy, and, in some cases, lung transplantation.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Multiple thin-walled cysts in the lungs on CT scan</li>
                <li>Chylous effusions may be seen on imaging</li>
                <li>Pneumothorax may be present</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP)</li>
                <li>Lymphoma involving the lungs</li>
                <li>Lymphatic spread of malignancy</li>
