            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections can present with a variety of symptoms depending on the organ system involved. Common symptoms include fever, weight loss, fatigue, and cough. In pulmonary infections, symptoms may include coughing up blood, chest pain, and shortness of breath.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections are more common in older adults and those with compromised immune systems. They can occur anywhere in the world but are more prevalent in certain geographic regions.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections are caused by environmental mycobacteria that are ubiquitous in soil and water. Infection usually occurs through inhalation or ingestion of the bacteria.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for non-tuberculous mycobacterial infections depends on the specific organism and the site of infection. It often involves a combination of antibiotics, such as macrolides, rifampin, and ethambutol, taken for an extended period of time.</p>
