            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Phyllodes tumors of the breast may present as a painless breast lump or mass. Rarely, they may cause breast pain, nipple discharge, or skin changes.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Phyllodes tumors are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all breast tumors. They typically occur in women between the ages of 30 and 70, but can occur at any age.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Phyllodes tumors are characterized by a leaf-like growth pattern on histology. They are classified as benign, borderline, or malignant based on their histological features.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for phyllodes tumors usually involves surgical removal of the tumor. In some cases, additional treatment such as radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be recommended, especially for malignant tumors.</p>
