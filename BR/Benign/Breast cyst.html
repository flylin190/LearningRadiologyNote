    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Benign breast cysts may present as a smooth, firm, or rubbery lump in the breast that is movable and may change in size with the menstrual cycle. They are usually painless but may cause discomfort.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Benign breast cysts are common in women, especially those between the ages of 30 and 50. They may be more common in women who are premenopausal or taking hormone therapy.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Benign breast cysts are fluid-filled sacs that form in the breast tissue. They are typically surrounded by a thin, fibrous capsule and are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most benign breast cysts do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. In such cases, the cyst may be drained using a fine needle aspiration.</p>
