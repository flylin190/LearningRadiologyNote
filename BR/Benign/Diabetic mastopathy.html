            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Diabetic mastopathy typically presents as a painless, firm breast mass or lump. It is usually unilateral and may be associated with skin thickening or retraction.</p>

            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Diabetic mastopathy is a relatively uncommon condition, occurring in approximately 0.6-3% of women with diabetes. It is more common in premenopausal women with long-standing, poorly controlled diabetes.</p>

            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Diabetic mastopathy is a fibrous breast disease characterized by excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagen and glycoproteins, in the breast tissue.</p>

            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment typically involves close monitoring and follow-up, as diabetic mastopathy is benign and does not require surgical intervention unless it causes significant discomfort or concern.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, irregular or spiculated mass on mammogram or ultrasound</li>
                <li>Increased density or architectural distortion</li>
                <li>May mimic breast cancer on imaging</li>

            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Breast cancer</li>
                <li>Fibroadenoma</li>
                <li>Radial scar</li>
