            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Gynecomastia is the enlargement of breast tissue in males, which can be bilateral or unilateral. It may be asymptomatic or associated with tenderness or pain in the breast area.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Gynecomastia is common and can occur at any age. It is most frequently seen in newborns, adolescents, and older men.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Gynecomastia is usually caused by an imbalance of hormones, specifically an increase in estrogen relative to testosterone. It can also be caused by certain medications, medical conditions, or recreational drug use.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Treatment for gynecomastia depends on the underlying cause. In many cases, no treatment is needed, and the condition resolves on its own. However, if gynecomastia is caused by an underlying medical condition or medication, treatment may be necessary.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>On mammography or ultrasound, gynecomastia appears as a glandular tissue enlargement behind the nipple-areolar complex.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Male breast cancer</li>
                <li>Pseudogynecomastia (breast enlargement due to fat deposition rather than glandular tissue enlargement)</li>
                <li>Lipoma</li>
            </ul>
