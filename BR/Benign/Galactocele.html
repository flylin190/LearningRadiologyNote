    <h1>Galactocele</h1>
    <section class="content">
        <div>   
            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Galactoceles are typically painless and may present as a smooth, firm, or cystic mass in the breast. They are most commonly found in women who are breastfeeding.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Galactoceles are more common in women who are breastfeeding or have recently stopped breastfeeding. They are caused by the accumulation of milk in the breast ducts.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Galactoceles are cystic lesions filled with milk. They are typically surrounded by a fibrous capsule and are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most galactoceles do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. In such cases, the cyst may be drained using a fine needle aspiration.</p>

            <h3>Imaging Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Well-defined, round or oval mass with smooth margins on ultrasound</li>
                <li>May contain milk with variable echogenicity</li>
                <li>Typically no associated calcifications</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Differential Diagnosis:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Simple breast cyst</li>
                <li>Fibroadenoma</li>
                <li>Other benign breast lesions</li>
