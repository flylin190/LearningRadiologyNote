            <h2>Symptoms:</h2>
            <p>Fibroadenomas are usually painless, smooth, rubbery, or firm lumps in the breast that are easily movable. They may change in size with hormonal changes, such as during menstruation.</p>
            <h2>Epidemiology:</h2>
            <p>Fibroadenomas are common in women under the age of 30, but they can occur at any age. They are more common in women who are premenopausal or taking hormone therapy.</p>
            <h2>Pathology:</h2>
            <p>Fibroadenomas are benign breast tumors composed of glandular and stromal tissue. They are typically well-defined and encapsulated.</p>
            <h2>Treatment:</h2>
            <p>Most fibroadenomas do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms or are of concern. In such cases, they may be surgically removed.</p>
